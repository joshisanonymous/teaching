  \paragraph{Description}
    The \emph{scientific} study of language, emphasizing such topics as the organization of grammar, language in space and time, and the relationship between the study of language and other disciplines.

  \paragraph{Objectives}
    At the end of the course, students, having read a substantial body of material related to the scientific study of language, will be able to use linguistic terminology accurately; to discuss basic linguistic facts, theories, and methodologies; to analyze samples of written or spoken language from a variety of world languages; and to understand both language change and how language supports all learning and communication. They will be prepared to undertake more advanced and specific linguistic studies.

  \paragraph{Topics}
    The topics will consist of writings about various linguistic matters, including phonetics/phonology, morphology, syntax, lexicons, and semantics, as they relate to the general fields of sociolinguistics, historical linguistics, language acquisition, cognitive linguistics, and language variation. A number of graded tasks will be assigned, such as quizzes, tests, and various writing assignments done either in or outside of class.

  \paragraph{Course Materials}
    Everything you will need to know will be presented in class, but reading is encouraged and we \emph{will use the book during class}.

  \paragraph{Attendance}
    Your class participation grade is mostly a function of your attendance: attend class, pay attention, ask a questions, and you will receive full credit. Three excused absences are allowed per semester (no need to explain), after which 1\% will be deducted from your final grade for each additional absence. If you find yourself in extentuating circumstances, please reach out sooner rather than later.

  \paragraph{Make-up Work}
    If you foresee that you will not be able to make it to an exam date or hand in an assignment on time, please get in touch with the instructor \emph{beforehand}. No make-ups will be allowed after the fact.
