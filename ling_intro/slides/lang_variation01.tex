      % "Variety" is generic term: any systematic or systematic-like form of language
        % List what it applies to as way to introduce more specific terms
          % Socio-political (i.e., systematic-like)
            % Languages: English vs French
            % Dialects: Appalachian English vs New York English
            % Sociolects: Working-class English vs Upper-class English
            % Registers: Newscaster English vs Infant Direct Speech
          % Real systems
            % Idiolect: one person's speech (treat this as encompassing all their styles?)
            % Styles: one speaker's English with their parents vs with their friends
        % Dialects
          % Geographically defined variety
            % Differences between dialects can be based on grammatical and lexical features
              % NOT just pronunciation: Accent is any variety that differs from another only in pronunciation
          % Cover that the negative connotation is not meant in sociolinguistics
            % Everyone's speech fits into a dialect
            % Everyone's speech fits into an accent
          % Speech community
            % Segments of the speech community are targetted using extra-linguistic factors
              % Define
              % Examples: Socioeconomic status, age, gender, ethnicity
            % (They talk about "pure" dialects spoken by speech communities that have "communicative isolation". Probably useless to talk about)
          % What makes languages and dialects different?
            % Mutual intelligibility, however:
              % Measuring it is difficult in the first place
              % Swedes and Norwegians can normally understand each other but speak different "languages"
              % People from different parts of China often can't understand each other but speak different "dialects"
              % Dialect continuums confuse the matter further
                % Define
                % At the Germany-Netherlands border, the Dutch and German speakers can often understand each other, even though speakers of those languages who don't live at the border often can't
            % What really makes languages and dialects different is that speakers consider them to be different
              % They are socio-political constructs
        % Sociolects and registers
          % Where dialects are geographically defined varieties ->
            % Sociolects defined by social class, economic class, or ethnicity more generally
            % Registers defined by activity
        % Idiolects and styles
          % Which utterance would you use to greet the Queen of England?
            % One is appropriate for the context, one is not
          % Definintions: styles first, idiolects next (repertoire of styles)
            % What counts as context? Same as in pragmatics: situational and social
          % Style shifting
            % Define
            % This typically happens subconsciously
        % Jargon and slang
          % Where do these fit in?
          % Both deal purely with lexical expressions
          % Define jargon
            % Useful in style shifting: employ it to sound in-the-know, avoid it to make yourself understandable to others
          % Slang is not well-defined in linguistics
            % Try to define it anyway
            % Useful in style shifting: marks one as being part of a group, in-the-know, and excludes others
        % Standards
          % No variety is superior to another: they're all rule-governed and equally logical
          % However, there are standard varieties
            % Define
            % Double negation example:
              % Used in Chaucer (1) but not considered standard today
              % Point is that the standard is structurally arbitrary
          % Desire to speak the standard for the prestige leads to hypercorrection
            % Use pronoun case in coordinate subjects and objects to demonstrate (3-7)
          % Standards for whole countries often given names:
            % US: Standard American English (SAE)
            % UK: Received Pronunciation (RP)
          % Non-standard varieties are not substandard
            % Maybe show example of reflexive pronoun construction in standard vs non-standard for discussion
            % Being able to use both is advantageous, actually
              % Covert prestige
