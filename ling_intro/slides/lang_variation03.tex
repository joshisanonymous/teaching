      % "how do we end up with geographic variation"
        % geographic factors
          % geographical isolation can lead to varieties that develop in their own direction
            % physical boundaries often correlate with dialect boundaries: isoglosses
              % an isogloss is for one variable
              % Bundles exist also
              % bundles are used to define dialect boundaries
                % they use map of Pennsylvania as an example
        % how we ended up with American dialects
          % trace settlement patterns
          % talk about interactions with non-anglo communities
            % native american languages
            % other european languages
              % French in Louisiana
              % German in Pennsylvania
              % Spanish later in the southwest
            % African slaves in the southeast brought languages
              % later AA migrations to northern cities
          % Show graph (3) with the resulting broad dialect boundaries
          % As for those indirect contacts (e.g., tv, internet)
            % working-class dialects have been stable, but middle-class dialects have homogenized to a degree
            % in part, because the culture of initial settlers has undue influence on later settlers
        % Characteristics of the supra-regional dialects
          % The North
            % Northern Cities vowel shift
              % Show diagram and then video of Labov explaining (https://youtu.be/9UoJ1-ZGb1w?t=59)
            % Use of gerunds: the table needs cleaning where elsewhere it's the table needs to be cleaned
            % Lexical differences, too
              % sneaker, pop, roly-poly
            % maybe talk about "by" where others use "at": I was by Sarah's house yesterday
