      % "what causes language variation"
        % first eg involves naming social factors for a person
          % (probably wanna stress that these are all indicators for who one associates with)
        % geographic factors
          % face-to-face interaction is more influencial than indirect contact
            % come up with an example
          % geographical isolation can lead to varieties that develop in their own direction
            % physical boundaries often correlate with dialect boundaries: isoglosses
              % an isogloss is for one variable
              % Bundles exist also
              % bundles are used to define dialect boundaries
                % they use map of Pennsylvania as an example
        % how we ended up with American dialects
          % trace settlement patterns
          % talk about interactions with non-anglo communities
            % native american languages
            % other european languages
              % French in Louisiana
              % German in Pennsylvania
              % Spanish later in the southwest
            % African slaves in the southeast brought languages
              % later AA migrations to northern cities
          % Show graph (3) with the resulting broad dialect boundaries
