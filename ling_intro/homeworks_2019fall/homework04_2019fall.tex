        The chart on the left is a vowel plot where each dot represents a vowel that was produced by a speaker from Georgia. The legend gives words that are each meant to represent a specific vowel (e.g., \textit{fleece} represents the [i] vowel). Each dot on the chart represents an occurrence of the vowel that matches the dot's color. Imagine the chart represents the sort of variation that you hear when you listen to people speak and use it to answer the questions below. (1 point each)
