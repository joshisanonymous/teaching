	abstract = {Distinctive linguistic practices help communities build solidarity and differentiate themselves from outsiders. In an online community, one such practice is variation in orthography, which includes spelling, punctuation, and capitalization. Using a dataset of over two million Instagram posts, we investigate orthographic variation in a community that shares pro-eating disorder (pro-ED) content. We ﬁnd that not only does orthographic variation grow more frequent over time, it also becomes more profound or “deep,” with variants becoming increasingly distant from the original: as, for example, \#anarexyia is more distant than \#anarexia from the original spelling \#anorexia. We ﬁnd that the these changes are driven by newcomers, who adopt the most extreme linguistic practices as they enter the community. Moreover, this behavior correlates with engagement with the community: the newcomers that adopt deeper variant orthography tend to remain active for longer in the community, and posts with deeper variation receive more positive feedback in the form of “likes.” Previous work has linked community membership change with language change, and our work casts this connection in a new light, with newcomers driving an evolving practice rather than adapting to it. We also demonstrate the utility of orthographic variation as a new lens to study sociolinguistic change in online communities, particularly when the change results from an exogenous force such as a content ban.},

While past researchers designed hundreds of formulas to estimate the difficulty of texts for readers, controversy has surrounded their use for decades, with criticism stemming largely from their application in creating new texts as well as their utilization of surface-level indicators as proxies for complex cognitive processes that take place when reading a text. This review focuses on examining developments in the field of readability during the past two decades with the goal of informing both current and future research and providing recommendations for present use. The fields of education, linguistics, cognitive science, psychology, discourse processing, and computer science have all made recent strides in developing new methods for predicting the difficulty of texts for various populations. However, there is a need for further development of these methods if they are to become widely available.},

We first extract 54 emerging words from the corpus by searching for words that are very uncommon at the end of 2013 but whose use rises dramatically over the course of 2014. We then map the origin and spread of each of these words. Based on these results, we identify the 5 main regional patterns of lexical innovation on American Twitter, primarily associated with the West Coast, the Northeast, the Mid-Atlantic, the Deep South, and the Gulf Coast. We conclude by proposing explanations for these results and by discussing their significance to theories of language variation and change, including both the actuation and diffusion of lexical innovations.},

Going beyond traditional sociological dichotomies such as agency/structure, individual/society, or micro/macro, Identity and Control presents a toolbox of concepts that will be useful to a wide range of social scientists, as well as those working in public policy, management, or associational life and, beyond, to any reader who is interested in understanding the dynamics of social life.},

	abstract = {Class does make a difference in the lives and futures of American children. Drawing on in-depth observations of black and white middle-class, working-class, and poor families, Unequal Childhoods explores this fact, offering a picture of childhood today. Here are the frenetic families managing their children's hectic schedules of "leisure" activities; and here are families with plenty of time but little economic security. Lareau shows how middle-class parents, whether black or white, engage in a process of "concerted cultivation" designed to draw out children's talents and skills, while working-class and poor families rely on "the accomplishment of natural growth," in which a child's development unfolds spontaneously—as long as basic comfort, food, and shelter are provided. Each of these approaches to childrearing brings its own benefits and its own drawbacks. In identifying and analyzing differences between the two, Lareau demonstrates the power, and limits, of social class in shaping the lives of America's children. The first edition of Unequal Childhoods was an instant classic, portraying in riveting detail the unexpected ways in which social class influences parenting in white and African American families. A decade later, Annette Lareau has revisited the same families and interviewed the original subjects to examine the impact of social class in the transition to adulthood.},

We propose now to consider more fully the bearing of the earlier results on this question and in particular to discuss what statements of value to the statistician in reaching his final judgment can be made from an analysis of observed data, which would not be modified by any change in the probabilities a priori. In dealing with the problem of statistical estimation, R. A. Fisher has shown how, under certain conditions, what may be described as rules of behaviour can be employed which will lead to results independent of these probabilities; in this connection he has discussed the important conception of what he terms fiducial limits. But the testing of statistical hypotheses cannot be treated as a problem in estimation, and it is necessary to discuss afresh in what sense tests can be employed which are independent of a priori probability laws.},

	abstract = {We learn language from our social environment, but the more sources we have, the less informative each source is, and therefore, the less weight we ascribe its input. According to this principle, people with larger social networks should give less weight to new incoming information, and should therefore be less susceptible to the influence of new speakers. This paper tests this prediction, and shows that speakers with smaller social networks indeed have more malleable linguistic representations. In particular, they are more likely to adjust their lexical boundary following exposure to a new speaker. Experiment 2 uses computational simulations to test whether this greater malleability could lead people with smaller social networks to be important for the propagation of linguistic change despite the fact that they interact with fewer people. The results indicate that when innovators were connected with people with smaller rather than larger social networks, the population exhibited greater and faster diffusion. Together these experiments show that the properties of people’s social networks can influence individuals’ learning and use as well as linguistic phenomena at the community level.},

Study 1 exploits the natural variation in social network size and shows that individuals with larger social networks are better at understanding the valence of restaurant reviews. Study 2 manipulated social network size by randomly assigning participants to learn novel evaluative words as used by two (small network) versus eight (large network) speakers. It replicated the finding from Study 1, showing that those exposed to a larger social network were better at comprehending the valence of product reviews containing the novel words that were written by novel speakers. Together, these studies show that the size of one's social network can influence success at language comprehension. They thus open the door to research on how individuals' lifestyle and the nature of their social interactions can influence linguistic skills.},

	abstract = {This article reviews the most commonly cited, representative, empirical studies in the peer-reviewed literature that directly investigate the association of gun availability and homicide victimization. Individual-level studies (n=4) are reviewed that investigate the risks and benefits of owning a personal or household firearm. The research suggests that households with firearms are at higher risk for homicide, and there is no net beneficial effect of firearm ownership. No longitudinal cohort study seems to have investigated the association between a gun in the home and homicide. Two groups of ecological studies are reviewed, those comparing multiple countries and those focused solely on the United States. Results from the cross-sectional international studies (n=7) typically show that in high-income countries with more firearms, both men and women are at higher risk for homicide, particularly firearm homicide. Time series (n=10) and cross-sectional studies (n=9) of U.S. cities, states, and regions and for the United States as a whole, generally find a statistically significant gun prevalence–homicide association. None of the studies prove causation, but the available evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that increased gun prevalence increases the homicide rate.},

While the linguistic categories are generally well-defined and there are sufficient tokens for further definition based on mathematical manipulation, the social characteristics such as socioeconomic class or ethnicity are neither. The familiar problem of grouping speakers by such sociological characteristics prior to quantitative analysis is addressed and an alternative solution -- principal components analysis -- is suggested. Principal components analysis is used here as a heuristic for grouping speakers solely on the basis of linguistic behaviour; the groups thus defined can then be described according to sociological characteristics. In addition, by naming the principal components, the major linguistic and social dimensions of the variation in the data can be identified. Principal components analysis was applied to vowel variation data collected as part of a sociolinguistic survey of English in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.},

The notion 'rule of grammar' is enlarged to include the formal treatment of inherent variation as a part of linguistic structure. Furthermore, a model is presented for the decisive solution of abstract questions of rule form and rule relations, based upon the direct study of linguistic behavior.},

It is argued that the degree of overlap of two individuals' friendship networks varies directly with the strength of their tie to one another. The impact of this principle on diffusion of influence and information, mobility opportunity, and community organization is explored. Stress is laid on the cohesive power of weak ties. Most network models deal, implicitly, with strong ties, thus confining their applicability to small, well-defined groups. Emphasis on weak ties lends itself to discussion of relations between groups and to analysis of segments of social structure not easily defined in terms of primary groups.},

The data consist of relative frequencies of rule application for different types of input string, and they provide a check on the frequencies predicted by variable rules. This study supports the hypothesis that the various features in rule structural descriptions tend to act independently, in the statistical sense, on rule probabilities. The analytic framework for variable rules is easily and naturally extendable to take into account the effect of sociolinguistic and stylistic features on application frequencies.},

Google is designed to crawl and index the Web efficiently and produce much more satisfying search results than existing systems. The prototype with a full text and hyperlink database of at least 24 million pages is available at http://google.stanford.edu/ To engineer a search engine is a challenging task. Search engines index tens to hundreds of millions of Web pages involving a comparable number of distinct terms. They answer tens of millions of queries every day. Despite the importance of large-scale search engines on the Web, very little academic research has been done on them. Furthermore, due to rapid advance in technology and Web proliferation, creating a Web search engine today is very different from three years ago. This paper provides an in-depth description of our large-scale Web search engine — the first such detailed public description we know of to date. Apart from the problems of scaling traditional search techniques to data of this magnitude, there are new technical challenges involved with using the additional information present in hypertext to produce better search results. This paper addresses this question of how to build a practical large-scale system which can exploit the additional information present in hypertext. Also we look at the problem of how to effectively deal with uncontrolled hypertext collections where anyone can publish anything they want.},

The community of practice provides a useful alternative to the speech-community model, which has limitations for language and gender researchers in particular. As an ethnographic, activity-based approach, the community of practice is of special value to researchers in language and gender because of its compatibility with current theories of identity. An extension of the community of practice allows identities to be explained as the result of positive and negative identity practices rather than as fixed social categories, as in the speech-community model. The frame-work is used here to analyze the linguistic practices associated with an un-examined social identity, the nerd, and to illustrate how members of a local community of female nerds at a US high school negotiate gender and other aspects of their identities through practice.},

I argue that the historical spread of the register was linked to the circulation of such discourses during the 18th and 19th centuries. I propose specific models for understanding the circulation of discourse across social populations and the means by which these values are recognized, maintained and transformed.},

We question these assumptions on several grounds. First, 'grammar' is arguably distinct from the processes driving speech production. Second, the role of grammar is mediated by the variable, poly-idiolectal repertoires of bilingual speakers. Third, in many instances of CS the notion of a 'base' system is either irrelevant, or fails to explain the facts. Fourth, sociolinguistic factors frequently override 'grammatical' factors, as evidence from the same language pairs in different settings has shown. No principles proposed to date account for all the facts, and it seems unlikely that 'grammar', as conventionally conceived, can provide definitive answers. We conclude that rather than seeking universal, predictive grammatical rules, research on CS should focus on the variability of bilingual grammars.},

	abstract = {AbstractIn a multilingual Lapland, globalization processes have various sociolinguistic effects. A good example is a change in the functions and values of the indigenous Sámi languages. The once solid community languages were pushed in the margins of the nation states in the early twentieth century. Today, Sámi linguistic and other semiotic resources are used not only for communication and building an indigenous community, but they function also as a commodity in global music markets and tourism, or as a resource for creative identity performance. This kind of a sociolinguistic change calls for an investigation that overcomes the macro–micro gap and concepts that address movements, diversity, and multiplicity in this multilingual situation. To this end, I fuse ethnographic and discourse analytical approaches in an attempt to track movements and conditions of Sámi resource mobility. The data examined in this article comprise multimodal discourse data (photographs, interviews, texts) and observations and recordings from ethnographic fieldwork in the North Calotte area of Lapland.},

	abstract = {This paper explores the construction of cultural identities through contemporary music from Madagascar, in particular the songs by Dama — singer-song-writer of the eponymous group of musicians- the Mahaleo. Specific focus is on the role that the discourses of and about popular Malagasy music play for the identity constructions of Malagasy people in Madagascar and abroad. Discussions about contemporary African music on the media and in the cultural studies literature, and the record industry’s own appropriation and commercialization of such music as generic ‘world music’ — tend to neglect the lyrics — and thus the often radical social critique — contained in these songs. Since much of African music is sung in languages not normally known to ‘Western’ audiences, their appreciation hinges on the vibrancy of rhythm and sound, to the exclusion of content. Yet to ‘home’ and ‘diasporic’ audiences, the texts are of huge significance. Our paper discusses the significance of language choice for popular music in Madagascar in the political movement of 1972 and its aftermath. We will also analyse in detail the lyrics of some typical songs from Mahaleo’s repertoire written by Dama. These will exemplify some of the ways in which the group attempts to encapsulate aspects of Malagasy every-day life, thus providing a cohesive link not only between several generations of Malagasies in Madagascar itself, but even more pronouncedly for those Malagasies who have left Madagascar and settled overseas. Finally, we will show the ways in which audiences create and perform ‘being Malagasy’ through the medium of their popular music, demonstrating the extent to which the project of ‘Mahaleo’ is being reflexively and consciously understood and taken up by their listeners.},

Numerous scholars maintain that the Japanese conflation of race with language establishes patterns of racial discrimination in which Japanese prefer not to use the Japanese language for inter-ethnic communication. Likewise, the Japanese language is rarely treated as a language of broader communication (i.e., global communication) by the Japanese. However, the recent development of the “language entertainment” genre of broadcast television actively challenges these stereotypes of Japanese ethnolinguistic identity. Furthermore, language mixing within Japanese popular music, especially mixing that results in “code ambiguation,” attempts to redefine ethnic identity by obscuring what language is used in pop music. These phenomena are interpreted according to possible ongoing changes of Japanese ethnolinguistic identity.},

A qualitative analysis of an Arctic Monkeys performance is carried out to determine the extent to which features of northern and/or more specifically Sheffield English are used by Arctic Monkeys. The results are then discussed within a language-ideological framework, where it is argued that Arctic Monkeys are using features of local accent and dialect to index values such as authenticity and independence from the corporate machine.},

One peculiarity of ragga soca is the borrowing of Jamaican Creole English phonological features into the performance genre. Initially, there was much opposition to this genre as it challenged notions of Trinidadian identity and self. This paper considers the linguistic innovativeness of ragga soca artists, in particular, their use of Jamaican Creole English phonological borrowings, demonstrating that they have not only created a new performance genre, but have used Jamaican Creole English to mediate their Trinidadian identity.},

Much of the research on accommodation focuses on the standard—nonstandard or on the local—nonlocal dimension. There is notably little research into accommodation from forms that are indexical of a particular ethnic identity to forms that are indexical of another ethnic identity. This article takes up the question of accommodation toward African American Vernacular English (AAVE) and New York Latino English (NYLE) among white ethnic immigrants in New York City who affiliate with hip-hop culture. It provides evidence to support a view of accommodation that stems from a strong attitudinal orientation toward the group with which a speaker wants to associate.},

	abstract = {The English of bilingual Cajuns living in southern Louisiana has been described as an accented variety of English, the result of interference from French. To investigate this proposition, a variationist study of four features of Cajun English are presented: (1) the interdental fricatives /(theta), (eth)/ realized by the dental stops [t, d], (2) the failure to aspirate the stops /p, t, k/, (3) the monophthongization of /ai/, \& (4) vowel nasalization. The data for this study are taken from the Cajun French/English Sociolinguistic Survey; the survey has confirmed that English has become dominant in these communities over the last two generations. A subsample of 28 speakers, divided by gender into three age groups, is taken from St. Landry Parish. If interference from French is the source of these features of Cajun English, there would be a steady decrease in frequency over apparent time so that these vernacular features will be used more frequently by the older \& less frequently by the middle-aged \& least of all by the younger generation. The results of GoldVarb analysis of the variables show a complex interrelationship of age, gender, \& social network. All of the variables studied followed the expected pattern; the older generation use more of the vernacular variants than all others; the middle-aged dramatically decrease their use of the vernacular but the young generation exhibit a number of complex patterns in their use of the vernacular features. Interestingly the young follow the decreasing pattern for /p, t, k/, but they show a level of usage for the other variables closer to the older generation so that there is a v-shaped age pattern rather than a pattern showing a steady decrease of the accented features of Cajun English. It is argued that although the vernacular forms produced by the older group can be considered part of an ethnic accent, they play a very different role in the younger generation, which can be attributed both to French language attrition \& to the on-going blossoming of a Cajun cultural renaissance. Being Cajun is now socially \& economically advantageous; the younger generation, unlike the middle-aged, take pride in their Cajun identity. The functions of French for people under 40 years old have been significantly reduced so that it is now generally limited to the family domain \& even more restricted in that it is used primarily in speaking with older members of the extended family. Given this situation, the only linguistic way to signal "Cajunness" is left to English. 5 Tables, 4 Figures, 1 Map, 38 References. Adapted from the source document},

The source data employed are drawn from student term papers collected between November 1998 \& May 2000. The papers are narratives of family language history; many include transcripts of interviews students conducted with family members. A synthesis of the information in the papers reveals that what individuals attribute to the singular facts of family history in fact represent, when taken together, patterns of loss applicable not only to CF in general but to myriad minority languages around the world. These papers also reveal a patchwork of attitudes toward Cajun French rather than monolithic agreement on its value to the community; the sources \& consequences of these attitudes are explored. A central goal of the discussion of these data is to highlight the value of narrative in studies of language loss. Specifically demonstrated is the role of punishment as not simply one of multiple factors but as a critically important factor in explaining the decline of CF \& the lack of a stable bilingualism in the Cajun community. 14 References.

This change is analyzed using transcriptions of free conversations \& oral translations by LCF speakers (N = 76) Ss were divided into three groups aged under 30, 30-54, \& 55+. Two kinds of changes are found in first person singular constructions: loss of emphatic or contrastive effect in the disjunctive pronoun moi 'me, myself', sometimes used as the subject replacing je 'I'; \& increasing occurrence of null subjects. Second person structures showed an increase in use of tu 'you' (informal singular) in polite contexts, a decrease in vous 'you' (polite singular) \& vous-autres 'you' (informal plural), \& elimination of most -ez verb endings. In the various 3rd person plurals, the pronoun ils 'they' \& virtually all subject-verb agreement were eliminated, younger speakers displayed a preference for using ca to designate 'they', \& the use of eusse \& eux-autres for 'they' was also in frequent use. The partitive pronoun en 'some of it/them' became a postverbal free morpheme zen. Some innovations appear with the losses, but the data confirm the decline of LCF. 34 References. E. Taylor},

The goal of this paper is to determine the origins \& the directions of language change within the system of locative prepositions. The majority of the interviews are taken from the Cajun French/English corpus, conducted by Dubois in 1997. Our results indicate that the restricted speakers use an array of innovative forms in all locative categories. Systemic \& extralinguistic evidence show that some of these forms represent interference-induced innovations, while others are internally-motivated innovations stimulated in an indirect way by language contact. A model of change emerges where the older restricted speakers introduce changes that are gradually adopted by the following generations, regardless of the extent to which their linguistic ability in Cajun French is diminished. 5 Tables, 1 Figure, 18 References.

First, can schools assume this new function? Second, should revitalization be accomplished by developing standardized forms of minority regional languages or by using variable local forms? The two issues will be discussed in the context of the revitalization of Louisiana French (Cajun), the traditional vernacular of the majority of the French (or French-related) speakers in southwestern Louisiana.

This dissertation focused on a diverse population of former French EPI students from two Louisiana parishes: St Martin Parish and Lafayette Parish who were enrolled at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette during the time of the study. A qualitative research design, incorporating ethnographic methods, was chosen to address the particular aims of the study to examine the immersion experiences and perspectives of these former EPI participants. These Louisiana students reveal a strong L2 foundation, but this foundation tends to weaken beyond immersion as there are fewer opportunities to increase and promote their French use. This study suggests that the overall essence of the immersion experience was good but challenging; there is an overall lack of language use carryover from immersion to post-secondary level. This study sought to reflect individual perspectives and offer to parents as well as immersion advocates and policymakers insight into some of the long-term impacts of French immersion at the post-secondary level.

It is suggested, however, that there may be a strong link between multilingualism \& enhanced cognitive functioning. This link is considered in light of experiences in Louisiana, which is officially French-English bilingual. Bilingualism was widely tolerated until the end of WWI, when speaking French in public was stigmatized. In the last 30 years, however, Louisiana has moved to preserve French by teaching it in all elementary schools. The emerging generation of French-English bilinguals is flourishing academically. It is argued that immersion programs encourage children to speak the target language with their teenaged peers \& that such programs need to be extended into middle school \& perhaps beyond. 55 References.

In the wake of the revival and in spite of continued shift, another trend is apparent -- the writing of Louisiana French. Whereas shift clearly represents a stage of language decline, the creation of a written code functions as a key ingredient for language maintenance.

Although linguists tend to portray the extinction of endangered minority languages as inevitable, research on the effects of minority language immersion education provides evidence that this portrayal is not an accurate one. In Louisiana, community concerns over the eminent death of Louisiana French and its associate culture have mobilised parents, educators and other advocates to establish French immersion programmes in public schools throughout southern Louisiana. Issues of regional and familial cultural identity have provided much of the impetus to expand these programmes in the region. As a result of the successful community-based efforts to create and extend immersion education in Louisiana, there is now a growing youth population proficient in Louisiana French, providing hope that the region's unique Francophone culture remains an enduring, active presence.},

	abstract = {As one of the rare Francophone regions in North America, Louisiana has a unique culture and French dialect, spawning from Acadian immigrants who came to the Louisiana colony in the latter part of the 18th century. As the Cajun identity evolved, several strong influences have shaped and formed the Cajun French language; yet, it remains in danger due to damages from a 1921 law prohibiting the use of French in Louisiana and increased exposure to Anglo-American culture. However, many efforts to promote Cajun French have been employed since 1968 and the creation of the Council for the Development of French in Louisiana (CODOFIL), especially regarding the implementation of French-language immersion programs. In order to obtain their goal of preserving the Cajun French dialect, CODOFIL first realized the need to reestablish a sense of linguistic and cultural pride in the Cajun community. By hosting the World Acadian Congress in 1999, Louisiana Cajuns were able to reinforce important ties with other French-speaking communities in Canada and worldwide, thereby establishing pride in their French heritage. This new cultural identity, coupled with the immense popularity of Cajun music in Louisiana offers another method of strengthening the precarious future of Cajun French by presenting a new way to attract younger generations to the dialect. This work will explore the status of the French language and music in Louisiana today, focusing on the ways in which a strong cultural element could provide important tools for protecting and promoting the unique Cajun French dialect.

To implement the program, it was necessary to import foreign teachers (from France, Quebec, \& Belgium), which generated opposition to the program \& led to a debate over the need for a French education program in the Louisiana context. Assessment of the program indicated that there was an increase in the number of French speakers both in the Acadian parishes \& even more in the rest of the state. In 1990, a CODOFIL survey showed 57\% of the respondents under age 19 spoke French. The language effort was supported by increased cultural production by Cajun musicians \& writers, \& there was also an increase in the popularity of Cajun music. Cajun authors played a role in the creation of a written norm for Louisiana Creole. It is suggested that most of the state's resources were geared to the educational effort. The rest of the resources were to improve the status of French by removing institutional obstacles \& promoting ethnic pride. The movement has resulted in modest success on the educational side, created a debate between those for \& against CODOFIL, \& is attempting to build an ideological concensus. 3 Tables, 102 References.

	abstract = {This mixed-method study examined French immersion teachers' attitudes toward French-related varieties of Louisiana (i.e., Cajun French and Louisiana Creole) and the extent these local varieties are integrated into their classrooms. Participants were employed as French immersion teachers during the 2008-2009 academic school year. In the past, Louisiana schools played a large role in the decline of Louisiana French and the fostering of negative attitudes toward these varieties. In fact, a slogan of the Council for the Development of French in Louisiana (CODOFIL) is L'ecole a detruit le francais, l'ecole doit le restaurer (School destroyed French, school must restore it). Research was collected in three distinct phases. During the first quantitative phase, ninety-two teachers completed a subjective reaction Matched Guise test by listening to and evaluating five different varieties of French (Cajun French, Louisiana Creole, Quebecois French, Acadian French of New Brunswick, and International French). During the second quantitative phase, ninety-one participants completed a background, attitudes, and integration questionnaire. Finally during the qualitative phase, twelve participants completed one-on-one interviews. The main findings suggest that participants in general have neutral attitudes toward Louisiana French and are open to integration and the Louisianification of the immersion curriculum but lack the content knowledge in order to teach these varieties to create the desired balance of International French and Louisiana French. Furthermore, participants felt that more efforts need to be made to hire local French immersion teachers to create more of a balance with teachers hired from abroad (i.e foreign associate teachers). Eleven main problems concerning the immersion program as did suggestions on how to make the profession more manageable emerged from the qualitative data. This study concludes that Louisiana French language and culture are minimally present in the immersion classroom. However, further efforts need to be made by teachers, administrators, grass-root organizations, and local community members if the immersion schools can be considered true supporters of language maintenance.

It suggests that if an ethnicity is associated with socioeconomic disadvantages, then the greater the ethnic identification of parents, the more disadvantageous for them ethnic traits will be. Therefore, ironically, parents who identify themselves as Cajuns and who live in Cajun ethnic areas may be less inclined to pass on French language abilities than are non-Cajun parents or parents in non-Cajun areas, once we control for the parents own language abilities. We use US Census data to examine this question and we employ qualitative data to attempt to explain why we find a particular type of association between Cajun ethnicity and French language transmission.},

The goals \& methods of the Council for the Development of French in Louisiana (CODOFIL) are considered unrealistic \& harmful. CODOFIL seeks to establish English-French bilingualism in Louisiana by teaching standard French in schools. Sociolinguistic obstacles to the program's success are explained. In addition, by setting up standard French as the norm, CODOFIL devalues regional dialects, neglecting to consult the population concerned. Four strategies for teaching Louisiana Cajun French \& Creole dialects in schools are reviewed: (1) teaching a normalized form of the vernaculars, assuming a knowledge of Standard French; (2) a diglossic model, which is contrasted to the Swiss High/Low German diglossic relationship; (3) bilingual instruction, an impractical approach given the lack of norms \& the fact that most native Louisianans are Anglophones; \& (4) introspective metalinguistic presentation of Louisiana French dialects in the context of Standard French instruction. Rationale \& methods for the last alternative are outlined. Although schools cannot realistically expect to revive a disused minority language, it is argued they can promote knowledge \& appreciation of it. 6 Tables, 1 Figure, 25 References. E. Taylor},

	abstract = {This study, based on Pierre Bourdieu's theory of linguistic domination and social relations of power, emphasizes the role of the school system in the reproduction, imposition, and inculcation of a legitimate dominant language to the detriment of minority languages. In Louisiana, schools have played a decisive role in language maintenance. Language of schooling has been a site of struggle for political and social domination. Two educational models, French and Anglo-American, conflicted over time for their principles, values, methods, and language use. During the colonization, French religious and private schools, designated for Creole elite, contributed to the reproduction and promotion of the French language. After Louisiana was purchased by the United States in 1803 and the American public education system was introduced in 1847, the French schools gradually assimilated into the American model. Educational systems suppressed French and promoted Americanization by imposing English as a symbolic power. The use of French was officially prohibited in public primary schools from 1921 to 1968. Formerly dominant, French has become a declining minority language. In 1968, Louisiana officially became a bilingual state. With the expansion of the French renaissance movement and the foundation of the Council for the Development of French in Louisiana (CODOFIL), schools have become the main agent for revitalizing the French language. However, this bilingualism is not institutionalized de facto. Louisiana is in a diglossic situation, where the second official language, French, has a lower status than English. According to the census, the number of French speakers (those who speak French at home) is decreasing steadily (by 24\% in 1990-2000). On the other hand, the linguistic variety valued in the schools is Standard French, in detriment of Cajun French and Louisiana French Creole, spoken in South Louisiana. The integration of these vernaculars in the school curriculum becomes a crucial factor for the preservation of the rich cultural and linguistic heritage of Franco-Louisianians. Schools, along with other social agents (family, community, church, media), have yet a mission to accomplish in order to prevent the decline of the French language as an integral part of ethnic identity.},

This study compared English and Spanish listeners' perceptions of English intervocalic consonants as a function of masker type. Three maskers (stationary noise, multitalker babble, and competing speech) provided varying amounts of energetic and informational masking. Competing English and Spanish speech maskers were used to examine the effect of masker language. Non-native performance fell short of that of native listeners in quiet, but a larger performance differential was found for all masking conditions. Both groups performed better in competing speech than in stationary noise, and both suffered most in babble. Since babble is a less effective energetic masker than stationary noise, these results suggest that non-native listeners are more adversely affected by both energetic and informational masking. A strong correlation was found between non-native performance in quiet and degree of deterioration in noise, suggesting that non-native phonetic category learning can be fragile. A small effect of language background was evident: English listeners performed better when the competing speech was Spanish.},

	abstract = {Perception of a phoneme may occur even when the speech sound is missing (e.g., when an extraneous noise replaces the sound). This phenomenon, called phonemic restoration, has been observed to depend on the type of distortion. It requires a replacing sound that provides acoustic input to the auditory system, since the restoration has not been found when a speech sound was replaced by silence. We examined the brain activation underlying speech processing when the word's initial phoneme was completely replaced by a silent gap. Event-related potentials (ERPs) and reaction times (RTs) were measured as indicators of semantic processing of sentence final words. Slower voice onset times during repetition of the manipulated words as compared to normal words indicated increased difficulty in retrieving their meaning. The N400, which is related to the increased demands of the semantic integration of words, was elicited by less expected words as compared to highly expected ones. For manipulated words, the N400 was elicited at the same latency than for normal words, with respect to the onset of the remaining word fragment. The amplitude of the N400 was not increased, nor did it last longer, thereby indicating successful retrieval of the word's meaning based on the semantic context and remaining phonetic information. Thus, semantic retrieval does not seem to require the word's initial phoneme to be present in a sentence context. The results suggest that both context-driven expectancy (top–down) and stimulus-driven processes (bottom–up) are utilized in word processing and contribute to the overall N400 response.},

It is a set of abilities that allows listeners to understand speech in the absence of important information, both spectral and temporal. AC is evaluated using monaural low-redundancy speech tasks: low-pass filtered words (LPFW), time-compressed words (TCW), and words- in-noise (WiN). Although not previously used, phonemic restoration with words (PhRW) is also a speech task that has been proposed as a measure of AC. In the present study, four tasks of AC, that are listed above, were used to evaluate AC skills in 50 adult females with normal hearing. Using pair-wise correlations, there were no significant relationships among LPFW, TCW, and WiN. As a result, these three tasks were considered to be independent components of AC that represented the AC abilities of spectral reconstruction, temporal resolution, and auditory induction, respectively. Multiple linear regression analysis with LFPW, TCW, and WiN as variables revealed that PhRW is accomplished using temporal resolution. The findings of this study show that no single task of AC is representative of the entire process and that further research is warranted to more completely define the skills that make AC possible.},

	abstract = {We present a schema-based model for phonemic restoration. The model employs missing-data ASR to decode speech based on unmasked portions and activates word templates that contain the masked phoneme via dynamic time warping. An activated template is then used to restore the masked phoneme. A systematic evaluation shows that the model is able to restore both voiced and unvoiced phonemes with a spectral quality close to that of original phonemes. Missing-data ASR relies on a binary mask generated by bottom-up CASA to label the speech-dominant time- frequency (T-F) regions of a noisy mixture as reliable and the rest as unreliable. However, errors in mask estimation cause degradation in recognition accuracy. Hence, we propose a two-pass ASR system that performs segregation and recognition in tandem. In the first pass, an n-best lattice, consistent with bottom-up speech separation, is generated. The lattice is then re-scored using a model-based hypothesis test to improve mask estimation and recognition accuracy concurrently. This two-pass system leads to significant improvement in recognition performance. By combining a monaural CASA system with missing-data ASR, we present a model that simulates listeners' ability to attend to a target speaker when degraded by the effects of energetic and informational masking in multitalker environments. Energetic masking refers to the phenomenon that a stronger signal masks a weaker one within a critical band. Informational masking occurs when the listener is unable to segregate target from interference. Missing-data ASR is used to account for energetic masking. The effects of informational masking are modeled by the output degradation of the CASA system in binary mask estimation. The model successfully simulates several quantitative aspects of listener performance including the differential effects of energetic and informational masking on multitalker perception. While missing-data ASR performs well on small vocabulary tasks, previous studies have not examined the effect of vocabulary size. In this dissertation, we investigate the performance of the missing-data ASR on a larger vocabulary task and compare its results to those of conventional ASR. For conventional ASR, we extract the speech signal from a noisy mixture by estimating a Wiener filter based on estimated interaural time and intensity differences within a T-F unit. For missing-data ASR, the same estimation is used to produce a binary T-F mask. We find that while missing-data recognition outperforms conventional ASR on a small vocabulary task, the performance of conventional ASR is significantly better when the vocabulary size is increased.},

	abstract = {How do the laminar circuits of neocortex learn categories that can support conscious percepts of speech and language? How do learned speech categories become selectively tuned to different temporal sequences of speech items that are stored in short-term working memory in real time? How does the brain use resonant feedback between working memories and learned categories to restore information that is occluded by noise using the context of a word or sentence? A model is developed to simulate how multiple laminar cortical processing stages interact to support a conscious speech percept. In particular, acoustic features are unitized into acoustic items. These items activate representations in an item-and-order, or competitive queuing, sequential short-term working memory. The sequence of stored working memory items interacts reciprocally with unitized representations of item sequences, also called list categories or chunks, in a multiple-scale categorization network, called a masking field, that is capable of weighing the evidence for groupings of variable-length sequences of items as they are stored in the working memory through time. List chunks represent the most predictive item groupings at any time. These bottom-up and top-down interactions between auditory features, working memory, and list chunks generate a resonant wave of activation whose attended features embody consciously heard percepts, notably the completed percepts that can form even when acoustic information may be missing or occluded by noise. This occurs in the auditory illusion known as phonemic restoration, even if the disambiguating speech context occurs after the occluding noise. This thesis provides the first explanation and simulation of how phonemic restoration arises in a laminar cortical hierarchy. It also develops a masking field that learns to respond robustly to input patterns from working memory as they unfold in time. Notably, for a given number of input items, all possible ordered sets of these items up to a fixed length can be learned. Both unsupervised and supervised learning simulations are provided. Supervised learning does not require as many list chunks to learn arbitrary sequences. Copies of dissertations may be obtained by addressing your request to ProQuest, 789 E. Eisenhower Parkway, P.O.

	abstract = {Phonemic restoration is the perceptual synthesis of phonemes when masked by appropriate replacement sounds by utilizing linguistic context. Current models attempting to accomplish acoustic restoration of phonemes, however, use only temporal continuity and produce poor restoration of unvoiced phonemes, and are also limited in their ability to restore voiced phonemes. We present a schema-based model for phonemic restoration. The model employs a missing data speech recognition system to decode speech based on intact portions and activates word templates corresponding to the words containing the masked phonemes. An activated template is dynamically time warped to the noisy word and is then used to restore the speech frames corresponding to the masked phoneme, thereby synthesizing it. The model is able to restore both voiced and unvoiced phonemes with a high degree of naturalness. Systematic testing shows that this model outperforms a Kalman-filter based model.},

	abstract = {The aim of this dissertation was to assess the perception of speech, voice and music in three groups of patients fit with cochlear implants. The patients in one group used the Advanced Bionics CII Bionic Ear system and the Hi-Resolution speech coding strategy. The patients in a second group used the Cochlear Corporation Esprit 3G processor and Advanced Combination Encoder speech coding strategy. The patients in a third group used the Med El Combi40+ system and CIS speech coding strategy. At issue was whether the different implant systems provided different levels of speech, voice or music recognition for patients. The results of Experiment 1 indicated that (i) patients can achieve high levels of speech understanding in quiet backgrounds, (ii) patients experience difficulty when speech is presented in noise backgrounds or at low levels, and (iii) patients achieved higher levels of speech understanding when speech was cued by information in the amplitude envelope than when speech was cued by information in the spectral domain. Differences in group mean performance were observed on tests of synthetic vowel recognition, the recognition of speech in noise and the recognition of speech at low levels. The pattern of results suggested that between-device differences in input dynamic range were responsible for most of time between-device differences in performance. In Experiment 2 the input dynamic range was increased from 30 to 40 dB in the 3C speech processor. The outcome was a significant interaction between device setting and performance in difficult listening situations. Increasing input dynamic range improved performance at low levels but degraded performance in noise. In Experiment 3 the input dynamic range was varied over the range 30-60 dB in the CII Bionic Ear system. The outcome was a significant increase in speech understanding at low levels and an increase in speech understanding in noise. The different results for patients fit with time 3G and CII system were likely due to differences in the compression functions used to expand input dynamic range in the two devices.},

In addition, benefits from clear speech in such conditions have been shown to be greater for NSs than for NNLs in speech perception. This study aimed to examine whether poor perception by NNLs is due to their limited usage of the contextual information or their abilities in processing acoustic‐phonetic signals, by investigating Chinese listeners’ ability in perceiving English sentences in varying linguistic contexts, such as semantic and syntactic cues, under different listening conditions. Sentences differing in degrees of semantic or syntactic acceptability produced by NSs of English were judged a different group of naive NSs of English on degrees of acceptability. All sentences were digitized and masked with white and babble noises with different signal‐to‐noise ratios (−4 and −8 dB). Listeners from three language backgrounds were recruited. Results showed that semantic and syntactic cues, as well as listening conditions, exhibited different degrees of facilitation in rewriting of keywords. Chinese speakers benefited more from marked syntactic structures, whereas English speakers found marked semantic contexts more facilitating.},

	abstract = {Different speakers may pronounce the same sounds very differently (with native or non-native accents, or atypical variants like lisps); and yet listeners have little difficulty perceiving speech accurately, especially after a bit of experience with a particular speaker. Recent research on perceptual learning suggests that listeners adjust their preexisting phonetic categories to accommodate speakers' pronunciations of those phonemes (Norris, McQueen \& Cutler, 2003). But the underlying processes that enable such learning, and the implications for linguistic representation, are poorly understood. In a series of experiments, I used variations on the perceptual learning paradigm to examine these issues. Listeners were exposed to a particular person's speech and later tested on their perception of critical aspects of that speech. The first three experiments investigated the nature of perceptual learning: Is learning specific to the speakers and phonemes heard during exposure? Does it result in temporary adaptations or enduring representational changes? Can listeners adjust to several speakers simultaneously? Taken together, Experiments 1-3 suggest that perceptual experience leads to very different learning for different types of phonemes. For phonemes that vary primarily on a spectral dimension, perceptual learning is very robust (shifts of approximately 15\%), long-lasting (the shifts are just as large 25 minutes later, even with intervening speech input), and speaker-specific. For such phonemes, the perceptual system is able to maintain several different representations simultaneously. In contrast, for sounds that vary on a timing dimension, perceptual learning is less robust (shifts of 4-5\%), generalizes to new speakers and new phonemes, and results in representations that need to be re-adjusted whenever a new pronunciation is encountered. In Experiments 4 and 5, I extended the study of perceptual learning to dialectal variations in pronunciation, and to production. The results suggest that the perceptual system handles dialectal variation quite differently than idiosyncratic variation: dialectal variation does not result in perceptual learning. Further, while listeners' productions can change to reflect speech they have just heard, their productions do not appear to change to reflect speech they have previously adjusted to (perceptually). This suggests that phonemic representations may not be shared by the perceptual and production systems.},

	abstract = {This study examined Australian English (AE) \& Thai-English bilingual (TE) speakers' ability to perceive word-final stops in their native \& non-native languages. In the perception experiment, the TE listeners were able to discriminate stop contrasts differing only in place of articulation (/p/-/t/, /p/-/k/, /t/-/k/) in both English \& Thai accurately, but the AE listeners' discrimination was accurate only for English. The listeners' discrimination accuracy was differentially influenced by the type of stop contrast they heard. The Thai /p/-/t/ contrast was most discriminable for both groups of listeners, in particular, the AE listeners. Acoustic analyses of the Thai stimuli presented in the perception experiment were conducted in order to search for cues that led to different response patterns for the AE \& TE listeners. There was a clear effect of the final stop on the formant trajectories of /a/ \& /u/, suggesting that these acoustic differences may be audible to the listeners. The results provide further evidence that first language (L1) transfer alone is insufficient to account for listeners' response patterns in cross-language speech perception \& that it is necessary to take into account phonetic realization of sounds \&/or the amount of acoustic information contained in the speech signal to predict accuracy with which sound contrasts are discriminated.

The data revealed that for Hebrew speakers, there was no effect of accent, whereas for the two bilingual groups (Russian and Arabic native speakers), stimuli with an accent like their own and the native Hebrew accent, required significantly less phonological information than the other foreign accents.

	abstract = {Speech perception rarely takes place in quiet environments, and for people with hearing impairment, difficulty understanding speech in noisy conditions is often the primary complaint. However, neither traditional clinical hearing tests nor a person's ability to understand speech in quiet can adequately predict the amount of trouble s/he will have in noise. Noise is also more detrimental to speech understanding for non-native and bilingual listeners than for monolingual listeners of a given language. This variability in performance within and across clinical and linguistic populations suggests that speech intelligibility in noise is modulated by both the auditory system and by experience-related cognitive factors such as a person's language background. Thus far, most research efforts have been directed toward auditory function; my dissertation aims to develop a fuller understanding of the particularly linguistic aspects of speech-in-noise perception. Building on the insight that speech-in-noise intelligibility may be modulated by listener experience, this dissertation has two primary aims: 1) to expand our understanding of the relationship between language experience and speech intelligibility in speech noise and 2) to identify parameters of auditory training that can facilitate speech-in-speech intelligibility. The first aim was addressed by assessing English sentence intelligibility in English and Mandarin babble by monolingual English speakers and non-native speakers of English whose native language is Mandarin. Results showed that both groups experienced greater difficulty in English versus Mandarin babble, but that Mandarin listeners received a smaller release from masking in Mandarin babble relative to English babble. These findings indicate that both the similarity between the target and the noise and the language experience of the listener contribute to the masking imposed by speech noise. The second aim was addressed with a training study, in which listeners received speech-in-noise training in speech-shaped noise, Mandarin babble, or English babble. Post-test performance showed that listeners were able to take advantage of target talker familiarity, and, after babble training, that they improved most in coping with the babble language in which they were trained. Speech-in-noise training, therefore, can enhance processes associated with both "tuning in" to speech targets and "tuning out" speech noise.

	abstract = {Behavioral research has documented that background noise impacts speech perception for non-native speakers more than for native speakers, even when the non-native language is acquired at an early age and is currently the dominant language of use. Neurophysiological studies comparing language processing in quiet for the bilingual and monolingual brain are plentiful; however the impact of noise on neural markers associated with semantic processing (i.e. PN/N400) for these groups has not been compared. The present study measured auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) to English words using a semantic priming paradigm for two groups of young adults: monolingual speakers of English and highly proficient bilingual speakers of Spanish/English. Participants listened to English word triplets (S1, S2, S3); they were instructed to decide if the third word was semantically related to either of the preceding words. Analyses of ERP waveforms time-locked to S1 and S2 provided an opportunity to evaluate how the brain processes semantic relationships between words without interference from a simultaneous overt response. Results confirmed essentially equivalent neural patterns of semantic processing of word triplets between groups under ideal listening conditions. In the presence of background babble, distinct differences between group activation patterns were evident at posterior electrode sites, however results also indicated widespread similarities between monolingual and bilingual listeners. In particular, both groups evoked interesting changes in anterior neural activity when processing target words (related or unrelated to a preceding word) compared to when processing the initial prime words. The noise condition also elicited significant interaction effects of listening condition and group, suggesting that background babble impacts neural responses associated with semantic processing differently for monolinguals versus highly proficient bilingual speakers. Implications of these findings are discussed in relationship to existing literature and the need for further study.

	abstract = {Background: There is strong evidence that bilinguals have a deficit in speech perception for their second language compared with monolingual speakers under unfavourable listening conditions (e.g., noise or reverberation), despite performing similarly to monolingual speakers under quiet conditions. This deficit persists for speakers highly proficient in their second language and is greater in those who learned the language later in life. These findings have important educational implications because the number of multilingual children is increasing worldwide, and many of these children are being taught in their non-native language under poor classroom acoustic conditions. Aims: The performance of monolingual, bilingual and trilingual speakers on an English speech perception task was examined in both quiet and noisy conditions. Trilingual performance was compared with that of monolingual and bilingual speakers. Methods \& Procedures: Monolingual speakers of English and early bilingual and trilingual speakers (i.e., acquired English as a second/third language before the age of 6 years) were recruited. Their fluency in English was tested by interview and by a questionnaire assessing their knowledge and use of the language. Audiological evaluation confirmed normal hearing in all participants. English speech perception was tested in quiet and in different levels of noise (50, 55, 60, 65 and 70 dB SPL) using the Speech Perception in Noise (SPIN) Test. Outcomes \& Results: Bilingual and trilingual listeners performed similarly to monolingual listeners in quiet conditions, but their performance declined more rapidly in noise and was significantly poorer at 65 and 70 dB SPL. Trilingual listeners performed less well than bilinguals at these noise levels, but not significantly so. A subgroup of five bilingual speakers who learned Arabic and English simultaneously since birth were poorer at higher levels of noise than monolinguals, but not significantly so. Conclusions \& Implications: The results replicate previous findings of poorer speech perception in noise with bilingual speakers compared with monolinguals and extend the findings to trilingual speakers.

Experiments explored whether object formation influences how information in the speech gaps is perceptually allocated. Experiment 1 replicates the finding that intelligibility is enhanced when speech-modulated noise rather than unmodulated noise is presented in the gaps. In Experiment 2, interrupted speech was presented diotically, but intervening noises were presented either diotically or with an interaural time difference leading in the right ear, causing the noises to be perceived to the side of the listener. When speech-modulated noise and speech are perceived from different directions, intelligibility is no longer enhanced by the modulation. However, perceived location has no effect for unmodulated noise, which contains no speech-derived information. Results suggest that enhancing object formation reduces misallocation of acoustic features across objects, and demonstrate that our ability to understand noisy speech depends on a cascade of interacting processes, including glimpsing sensory inputs, grouping sensory inputs into objects, and resolving ambiguity through top-down knowledge.},

	abstract = {In this model, speech perception is characterized as a purposeful, information-seeking activity whereby adult listeners detect the most reliable acoustic parameters that specify phonetic segments and sequences in their native language (L1), using highly over-learned selective perception routines. In laboratory perceptual tasks, differentiation of L1 phonetic contrasts is rapid and robust even in suboptimal listening conditions and even when the listeners focus on other levels of language structure, or indeed on another task. In contrast, late second language (L2) learners must employ greater attentional resources in order to extract sufficient information to differentiate phonetic contrasts that do not occur in their native language. Phonetic and phonological modes of speech perception are described, which can be tapped in the laboratory by manipulations of stimulus complexity and task demands. These experimental manipulations reveal complex interactions between the linguistic experience of listeners and phonetic similarity relationships between L1 and L2 phonological inventories. Illustrative experimental evidence from my studies of vowel perception using perceptual assimilation (cross-language identification), speeded discrimination, discrimination in speech babble, and brain indices of discrimination (MMN) are presented to provide operational definitions of these concepts. Similarities and differences from other current theories of cross-language and L2 speech perception are discussed. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]},

The role of the mental lexicon in phonemic restoration \& speech perception as a whole was investigated in 2 experiments. Experiment 1 (N = 40) examined whether the perceptual process is sensitive to the number of words that match an utterance with a phoneme missing. In the first part of the experiment, stimuli included pseudowords created by splitting test words in half \& interchanging the halves to create items that shared the same phonemes but none of the lexical properties. The second part contrasted primed \& unprimed presentation formats. Experiment 2 (N = 36) examined uniqueness as a function of time. Ss made the same added-replaced judgment used in experiment 1 on words that were contrasted in having unique syllables either early or late in the word. Experiment 1 showed that the presence of multiple candidates enhanced word restoration. In experiment 2, words with relatively unique first syllables produced stronger phonemic restoration effects later in the word. None of these effects was noted for the pseudoword stimuli. Results complement other findings supporting an active role for lexical representation in the perception of speech. 9 Tables, 2 Figures, 18 References. B. Annesser Murray},

For example, when the initial phoneme of a word is obliterated and replaced with noise, listeners hear it as intact provided there is semantic context. We modified this phonemic restoration paradigm by masking (not obliterating) the initial phoneme of a target word and presenting it within a carrier phrase which was informative (I), uninformative (U), or misinformative (M). Bias in favor of top-down context was measured as the extent to which M trials mislead listeners into reporting a target word other than that which was presented (relative to U trials that have irrelevant top-down semantic context). Forty-one participants (20 men) completed 600 test trials (300 delayed report of the phrase, 300 forced choice). Relative to the U condition, women were more affected by both the I and M cues than men, at certain levels of audibility during the forced choice condition. Moreover, the semantic strength of the I carrier phrases was correlated with the rate of correct reports of the target words in women but not in men. This suggests that women can be more affected by top-down semantic context than men.},

This is followed by a parallel, yet orthogonal classification of ACs based on the locus of their effect: Perceptual processes, mental representations, attention, and memory functions. We then review the added value that ACs provide for theories of speech recognition, with a focus on fundamental themes in psycholinguistics: Content and format of lexical representations, time-course of lexical access, word segmentation, feed-back in speech perception and recognition, lexical-semantic integration, interface between the speech system and general cognition, neuroanatomical organisation of speech processing.

Next, the authors provide a detailed discussion of methodological frameworks, including types of experimental tasks, for perception research. Within this context, the experimental paradigms are illustrated and critically evaluated. Strange and Shafer go on to provide an overview of current models of L2 speech perception, including the Native Language Magnet Model, the Perceptual Assimilation Model and Speech Learning Model, and discuss major theoretical issues, such as cross-language phonetic similarity. In addition, they address recent neurobiological approaches to the study of L2 speech perception, including electrophysiological measures of discrimination. They conclude their chapter by presenting a 'tetrahedral model' that provides a framework for considering several experimental variables for the design, interpretation and evaluation of L2 speech perception studies.

	abstract = {This thesis is meant to further our understanding of an important variable in speech communication, fundamental frequency (F0). Towards this goal, I investigated F0 perturbation by consonants and lexical tone restoration in continuous speech of Mandarin Chinese. Mandarin is atone language and its lexical tones have relatively stable F0 patterns, which offer good references for studying various effects on surface F0, contours. F0 perturbation by consonants is an involuntary F0 variation during speech production. The clarification of involuntary effects on pitch movements can provide a baseline for studying the communicative factors and shed light on underlying mechanisms of articulatory constraints. By analyzing the main effect of consonant perturbation on F0, I found that Mandarin voiceless consonants give rise to higher F0 onsets in the following vowel as opposed to nasal consonants, with aspirated stops associated with lower values than their unaspirated cognates. By analyzing the interaction of consonant perturbation with lexical tone and tonal coarticulation on F0 I proposed that this perturbation effect is attributable to myoelastic factors, as well as aerodynamic factors. The analyses of interaction also show that the effect of consonant perturbation is local and it does not change the underlying pitch targets of lexical tones or the performance of tonal coarticulation. Rather, it is superimposed onto the F0 contours resulting from known contextual tonal variations without altering the general course of the F0 movements. The above findings of diverse F0 variations in speech production may raise the question as to how those F0 variations operate in speech perception. Based on the broad distribution of tonal information in the speech signal, I hypothesized that F0, may function as a robust acoustic cue in auditory compensation and tested this hypothesis with experiments on phonemic restoration. The important function of F0 in auditory compensation is confirmed by the evidence that contextual tonal variations resulting from carryover effects can lead to restoration of lexical tones. This finding suggests the importance of taking advantage of the robustness of the F0 cue in speech technology so that ASR systems can be applied to real-life environments.},

This paper culturally analyzes the influences on and implications of the mash‐up phenomenon. By conducting a close reading of press articles and several interviews and textually analyzing some of the most popular and critically acclaimed tracks, I argue that the mash‐up is a response to larger technological, institutional, and social contexts. Through themes of irony, empowerment, and re‐appropriation, the mash‐up serves as a fitting expression of today's youth media experience.},

	abstract = {Critical evaluations of audio mash‐ups and remixes tend to congregate around two poles. On the one hand, these often clever re‐combinations of recorded music are celebrated as innovative and creative interventions in the material of bland commodity culture. On the other hand, they are often reviled as derivative, inauthentic, and illegal because they do nothing more than appropriate and reconfigure the intellectual property of others. This essay does not side with either position but identifies and critiques the common understanding and fundamental assumptions that make these two, opposed positions possible in the first place. The investigation of this matter is divided into two main parts. The first considers the traditional understanding of technologically enabled reproduction and the often unquestioned value it invests in the concept of originality. It does so by beginning with a somewhat unlikely source, Plato's Phaedrus—a dialogue that, it is argued, articulates the original concept of originality that both determines and is reproduced in the theories and practices of sound recording. The second part of the essay demonstrates how the audio mash‐up deliberately intervenes in this tradition, advancing a fundamental challenge to the original understanding and privilege of originality. In making this argument, however, the essay does not endeavor to position the mash‐up as anything unique or innovative. Instead, it demonstrates how mash‐ups, true to their thoroughly derivative nature, plunder, reuse, and remix anomalies that are already available in and constitutive of recorded music.},

Several references to Elgar's Violin Concerto are highlighted in the first and second movements of the quartet, and broader stylistic referencesto Dvořák and Debussy are also identified. Explanations are suggested for these references, based on parallels drawn between Bax's musical practice in this work, the composer's early reception, and his prose writings in the Musical Standard and Musical Herald, which discussed ‘artistic good faith’, musical influence and the difficulties of creating a national style in British music.},

	abstract = {George Crumb's Black Angels: Thirteen Images from the Dark Land for Electric String Quartet (1970) are individually original, but also representative for compositional practices for the twentieth century. As in his other compositions, Crumb has integrated musical quotations and various musical styles, including a web of references that extend into other media in such a way that they form an indispensable part of the basic construction of the work: these components form part of its newness. In Black Angels the composer—among other well-known pieces of music—quotes the medieval `Dies irae' sequence and the second movement of Schubert's string quartet in D minor (D. 810). The musical and intermedial references are framed with striking modernistic sounds exploring instrumental possibilities far beyond the traditional, thus creating a framework of extreme contrasts. The paper will contextualize, analyze and interpret Black Angels—which the composer explicitly linked to the Vietnam War—in a broad context of music, intermediality, religious symbolism, and cultural memory, pointing to the cultural meaning of this technique of recontextualization as a break with, as well as a continuation of, modernity.},

Governing these are the main sources of borrowings; the polysemic complexity of interrelations and dialogues between loan-music and the music absorbing it (a dialectical network). Musical quotations have various functions, their context an essential factor in conditioning signification: Some quotations are context-sensitive, some context-free. There are negative and positive reasons for employing quotations, and several types of quotation: parole quotation, langue quotation, quotation-symbol, crypto-quotation, hetero-codal quotation, quotation-signature, as well as collage.

	abstract = {Abstract In music genre classification, most approaches rely on statistical characteristics of low-level features computed on short audio frames. In these methods, it is implicitly considered that frames carry equally relevant information loads and that either individual frames, or distributions thereof, somehow capture the specificities of each genre. In this paper we study the representation space defined by short-term audio features with respect to class boundaries, and compare different processing techniques to partition this space. These partitions are evaluated in terms of accuracy on two genre classification tasks, with several types of classifiers. Experiments show that a randomized and unsupervised partition of the space, used in conjunction with a Markov Model classifier lead to accuracies comparable to the state of the art. We also show that unsupervised partitions of the space tend to create less hubs.},

It includes various tasks, such as music classification, clustering, perception and cognition, etc. In this article, we report our recent perceptual studies on segmentation and genre classification, two indispensable steps in the MIR process. Segmentation attempts to capture ‘drastic’ changes in music and provides a basis for further perceptual and computational analysis while genre classification amounts to separating music into different groups such that each group uniformly represents a music genre. Our perceptual study considers various related issues. The goal of this work is to (1) explore and deepen our understanding of the relationship between perceptual surface and perceptual structure of music through segmentation by human subjects and (2)reveal and demonstrate the multi-label nature of genre classification.},

Understanding the similarities and differences in concepts associated with various genres may improve the efficiency with which music is used for communication. Two online experiments presented brief portions of instrumental country or hip-hop music to 284 participants at a large midwestern US university. The first experiment tested for differences between concepts associated with country and hip-hop music. The second experiment examined the ability of the same music genres to influence person perception in regard to those same concepts. Significant differences were found not only in concepts typically used to define the genres, such as ethnicity, rural—urban classification and age, but also in other concepts that play an important role in communication research and persuasion, such as trustworthiness, friendliness and political ideology.},

	abstract = {Although the phonology of schwa in Standard French has been extensively studied, the same is not true of many varieties of French. and in particular of Cajun French. This paper will focus on word-initial metathesis, a widespread phenomenon of Cajun French. Word-initial metathesis occurs either after a consonant cluster (e.g. grenier-gernier ‘attic’) or after a single /r/ (eg. retourner-ertourner ‘to return’), in which case the conditioning environment is larger than the phonological word. I will show that the two phenomena are two aspects of the same process. I will first consider two non- linear approaches to metathesis and show that they are both unable to explicitly point out the triggering force of the sonorant /r/. I will present a prosodic analysis where the initial syllable is degenerate in that it lacks a vocalic nucleus. Epenthesis of a vocalic segment will save the deficient syllable. Surface differences between the two types of metatheses will be attributed to weight distinctions within the French syllable. It will be claimed that epenthesis, a powerful device which should be highly constrained, is well motivated in the present context because the segments involved form a natural phonetic class.},

	abstract = {The dissertation research explores the survivability of Louisiana French and St Lucian French Creole (Kweyol). Most sociolinguistic research on minority languages has focused on language death and has ignored global process. However, the continued and renewed salience of ethnicity as a social organizer gives reason to expect that the death of many minority languages may be arrested or reversed. The Louisiana and St Lucia cases are significant in that Louisiana French and Kweyol have both been the object of organized efforts at revaluation since the 1960s. The cases are also significant from a comparative, global perspective because of their integration into broader pan-cultural movements and the different positions they occupy within the world-system. This study investigates in relation to each case: (1) the global processes that are associated with ethnic revival, (2) the nature of ethnic revival and (3) the association between the ethnic revival movements, on the one hand, and patterns of language use and language attitudes, on the other.
The project uses a comparative approach to identify common themes and to isolate phenomena unique to each case. Data from secondary sources inform global process, the ethnic movements and the sociohistorical narratives of each case. Interviews with randomly selected residents and the protagonists of linguistic preservation and promotion in Louisiana and St Lucia furnish data on ethnic revival and on the sociolinguistic status of Louisiana French and Kweyol. The findings support the thesis that Louisiana French and Kweyol ethnic revival is associated with changes in the hegemonic status and the integration of the world-system. However, ethnic revival in Louisiana and St Lucia has only partially arrested the decline in the use and viability of Louisiana French and Kweyol. English remains the predominant language of social discourse in all public domains of language use, although Louisiana French and Kweyol have made some gains. Moreover, despite the revival movements, English continues to usurp social space from the ethnic languages in private domains of use as well. The greatest effect of ethnic revival on the survivability of Louisiana French and Kweyol lies in the positive changes of people's attitudes toward the languages.},

Through a largely qualitative analysis, a longitudinal picture is sketched of the way certain styles of singing have shifted over time. Wherever possible, these linguistic changes are charted against the broader cultural, cross-cultural \& sociopolitical changes which parallel them \& which, arguably, have helped shape them. 37 References.

I did a one-year ethnographic study of the Korean language classes (basic and intermediate levels) at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, which were largely populated by second- and 1.5-generation Korean Americans. From these Korean-American college students, who have 'successfully' negotiated through the American educational system, I learned that becoming an English speaker does not necessarily mean the loss of ethnic identity, and that learning Korean (a 'heritage' language) does not necessarily lead to homogeneous ethnic identity formation. Although the classroom is certainly a place in which language knowledge is imparted, much classroom activity utilises words and grammatical points as semantic mediators of culture, history, and even politics; in short, the stakes are high. My ethnography focuses on the micro-practices of language teaching and learning in order to explore these interactions, and thereby take up identity formation and transformation. Participants' personal language repertoire and use reflect diverse social worlds and locations (including time of immigration, place of residence, and relationship to the homeland) through which their transnational lived histories have been constituted.},

Genealogy is also an important and highly prized means of identification. In this article the saying of Te Whānau Moana group of extended families (hapū) of Karikari in the far northern region of the country is explained as an example. Given that such sayings are always expressed in Māori, the question arises as to how children whose parents and teachers are not good speakers of Māori will fare in terms of identity. Difficulties in the Māori language of teachers and children in Māori-language immersion preschools and schools (kōhanga reo and kura kaupapa Māori) are identified as grammar-related. Solutions are suggested whereby the grammar of second-language learners can be improved.},

Spanish language is central to resisting such phenotype-racial categorization, which denies Dominican Americans their Hispanic ethnicity. Through discourse analysis of naturally occurring peer interaction at a high school, this article shows how a Dominican American who is phenotypically indistinguishable from African Americans uses language, in both intra- and inter-ethnic contexts, to negotiate identity and resist ascription to totalizing phenotype-racial categories. In using language to resist such hegemonic social categorization, the Dominican second generation is contributing to the transformation of existing social categories and the constitution of new ones in the US.},

The authors found evidence of discriminant validity. By using 3 approaches to construct validity, they found that the support for discriminant validity strengthens the discriminant \& convergent properties of the instrument. Findings concerning method effects were less obvious. If the traditional multitrait-multimethod approach indicates no method effects, more stringent approaches (e.g., analysis of variance \& correlated uniqueness approach) indicate the presence of limited method effects.

	abstract = {Language planning in the domain of the courts in Cyprus is of interest because of the concealed salience placed upon the link between language and either state or ethnic identity. The article first examines the dominant role of English in court from 1960 until 1988 as reflecting Cyprocentric state identity associations. It then investigates the establishment of the use of Greek after the enactment of Law N.67/1988 brought the reversal of the linguistic situation. The law, which aimed at putting into action the provisions on language of the 1960 Constitution of the Republic of Cyprus and at safeguarding the use and protection of Greek, derived from Hellenocentric tendencies and its ultimate purpose was to foster Greek ethnic identity rather than to enhance the identity of the state of Cyprus. The above observations are illustrated in the analysis of the legislation on language in the courts, the linguistic situation in the judicial proceedings, and the court verdicts/judgments pertaining to language use. Finally, the article draws parallels between Fishman's `nationism' and `nationalism' and the Greek-Cypriots' language selections and identity orientations.},

	abstract = {Abstract A growing body of literature has explored issues surrounding the maintenance and development of a minority heritage language among immigrants and their children in relation to their ethnic identities in multi-ethnic societies. However, most of the studies either have alluded to heritage learners' language competence by way of their attitudes and ideologies toward their heritage and language maintenance or have addressed their competence by way of self-assessment measures alone. This study examines the interrelationship between Korean heritage learners' perceived and actual competence in Korean vis-à-vis their ethnic identity orientation. Thirty second-generation Korean-American participants completed questionnaires on their language background, ethnic identity orientation, and self-assessment of their speaking and writing skills in Korean. Their speech and writing samples in Korean were elicited with picture stimuli. Results suggest that there was a strong correlation among the subjective and objective assessment of the heritage learners' Korean language skills and their Korean ethnic identity. It was also suggested that the heritage learners who have a strong Korean identity tend to have better competence in Korean, meaning that the strong Korean identity serves as a self-enhancing bias in their self-assessment of the Korean language.},

	abstract = {While the global ethnic revival, starting in the late 1960s, resulted in minorities' movements to maintain their ethnic identity closely connected with the revitalization of minority languages, the other ethnic identity pattern in relation to language can be identified from the perspective of a rarely discussed minority group-the Buryats. This article has found that within the Buryat minority group the assimilation strategy, widespread during the Soviet period, has been replaced by the integration strategy and a combination of strategies. In the latter case, linguistic integration is combined with the economic assimilation and marital separation. Two options have been identified regarding the language and identity link among Buryats. First, the native language is considered a salient feature of the Buryat ethnic identity, and it is actually used and maintained. However, more powerful is the trend to abandon the language as an irrelevant ethnocultural identity marker. In general, the native language has for Buryats a rather symbolic, unifying value and its abandoning does not affect the ethnic identity itself. Finally, the article explores external and internal determining factors, which have formed this identity pattern. As external factors we consider the ethnic and language policy of the Soviet Union, modernization, the Russian-dominated majority-minority configuration, and insufficient institutional support of the Buryat language restoration and development. The internal factor is the widespread attitude among the Buryats themselves consisting of a negative evaluation of the Buryat language and unwillingness to learn it and to transfer it to the next generations. The Buryat case shows that ethnic identity, in fact, can survive the loss of the indigenous group language, which has been sacrificed to the historical pressures of the last two centuries. It was the only possible ethnic identity pattern not only for the Buryat ethnic group, but also for many other minorities in Russia.},

Attractive to some and disturbing to others are the attitude and flair of Kriolu rappers. A group of mostly young men of Cape Verdean descent, these rappers insist on speaking and singing in Kriolu, a creole language that lacks official-language status in both Portugal and Cape Verde. In this article, based on analyses of rap lyrics, excerpts from my fieldwork conversations with rappers, and structural features of the Kriolu language itself, I propose that Kriolu rap is a renewed interrogation of diaspora and of place-based identity. More generally, I propose that, when contextualized in terms of cultural history and (post)colonial politics, Kriolu rap offers insight into the relationship between words and music as part of a process of combining aesthetics with social claims.

The discussion is based on illustrations drawn from a variety of sources, ranging from Western pop to North African rai music. The strategies identified include using translation to either replace or reduplicate the source material, rewriting with varying degrees of divergence from the original, juxtaposing components from different languages, and composing directly in a code switching variety. It is argued that in such lyrics translation and code switching often serve to produce very similar effects. Both may be used as affirmations of identity, as in-group markers, as stylistic devices, as a means of opening up the lyrics to outsiders or of producing effects such as alienation and exclusion. The effects achieved in particular cases are related to such variables as the identity of the performer/persona, the background of the audience and the specific content and theme of the song.

By aligning Nigerians' cultural and political experiences with those of African Americans and Jamaicans-whose languages have also been stigmatized as 'broken English'-these artists engage a Black Atlantic cultural tradition while simultaneously indexing a distinctly Nigerian public within that imagined transnational space. The formation of this public is complicated, however, by (among other things) the fact that Hausa-speaking Muslims from northern Nigeria are less likely than other Nigerians to use and affiliate with NP.

Australian Hip Hop, though, appears to be phonologically defying the conventions of lyrical performance which have been held, to a greater or lesser extent, since rock ‘n’ roll's emergence in Australia. This paper examines this interesting sociolinguistic phenomenon by providing a picture of phonological variation within youth music in Australia, enabling a comparison between Hip Hop and other genres. It argues that performance accent is closely tied to several factors, including cultural identity and genre appropriateness. In the case of Hip Hop, a local identity is maintained linguistically, in keeping with Hip Hop's philosophy of keepin’ it real, suggesting that the genre is simultaneously loyal to and distinct from its American origins.},

The size of a mixed English constituent in K-Pop lyrics varies from a single word to an entire song. The manifestation of linguistic sophistication differs from Koreanized English only intelligible to the Korean public to American English with African American Vernacular English (AAVE) features. Functions of English mixing are also varied from a simple attention-getter for stylistic purposes to assertion of liberated self and exercising freedom of speech. K-Pop is a sociolinguistic breathing space for young South Koreans to construct identity and socially connect with others. The findings of the study show that K-Pop provides discursive space for South Korean youth to assert their self-identity, to create new meanings, to challenge dominant representations of authority, to resist mainstream norms and values, and to reject older generations’ conservatism. English is used as discourse of resistance. Young South Korean artists are empowered by tactical English switches into Korean. Appropriations between global and local dialogues yield resultant linguistic hybrids. Mixing two language codes epitomizes South Korean youth's battle with their unsettling identities in dealing with the tension between global and local dialogues to which they are simultaneously exposed.},

Here we look more closely at the type of grammatical knowledge involved in intrasentential CS, by examining a widely attested structure in CS, bilingual compound verbs (BCVs). We consider the properties of compound verbs in general, including in monolingual contexts, their significance in the CS literature, notably for the notion of Matrix Language, and their implications for an understanding of bilingual grammars, broadly defined. We conclude that this widespread feature of bilingual speech is more than a convenient frame for inserting foreign words, and should be seen as part of a more general verb-formation process. The types of linguistic knowledge which allow such formations to emerge are based on what Sebba (1998) has called conceptual work, rather than on the simple interaction of two linguistic systems as such. We list a number of factors to be taken into account in trying to identify a CS grammar, within which idiolect, metalinguistic knowledge and community norms are particularly significant.},

In addition, a corpus of speech from the same teenagers is examined tot comparison. Targeting well-known IM features and four areas of grammar, we show that IM is firmly rooted in the model of the extant language. It reflects the same structured heterogeneity (variation) and the same dynamic, ongoing processes of linguistic change that are currently under way in contemporary varieties of English. At the same time, IM is a unique new hybrid register exhibiting a fusion of the full range of variants from the speech community--formal, informal, and highly vernacular.},

	abstract = {The present study investigates the use of a standard Catalan deontic modal construction haver de + infinitive 'to have to' and the nonstandard variant tenir que + infinitive 'to have to' in Twitter entries originating from eight cities, representing different Catalan dialects. Although the nonstandard form has been labeled in the literature as a calque of Spanish tener que + infinitive 'to have to', it appears in Twitter messages in all of the dialects analyzed. In fact, in our sample there are dialects in which tenir que occurs more frequently than haver de. Grammatical person of the verb used (haver or tenir) is also analyzed as a factor behind the choice of modal periphrasis. Multivariate analysis has been employed, determining that both of these factors (dialect and grammatical person) are statistically significant. The results of the multivariate analysis allow us to apply van Coetsem's (1988) theoretical framework in an attempt to describe the language contact situation in the different dialects. Source-language (sl) agentivity appears to be at work in the dialects where the nonstandard variant is prevalent, while recipient-language (rl) agentivity could be behind the use of the standard variant in the other dialects.},

We also found the level of linguistic variation correlated with how isolated a community was: evidence that there is Convergence between linked members.

	url = {http://www.archipel.uqam.ca/8590/},
	abstract = {En langue des signes québécoise (LSQ), des différences linguistiques entre les productions de femmes et hommes sourds, ayant été scolarisés par des institutions religieuses distinctes avant 1960, ont été révélées (Dubuisson et Grimard, 2006). Ces variations peuvent être liées à l'exposition de ces sourds à des méthodes éducatives différentes sur le plan des langues des signes utilisées pour l'enseignement (Langue des signes française (LSF) pour les hommes, American sign language (ASL) pour les femmes (Veillette et al., 2005)) ainsi qu'au différent degré d'exposition au français oral également utilisé pour l'enseignement (Perreault, 2006) distinguant le groupe oralisant du groupe signant. Les travaux effectués jusqu'à maintenant sur les différences linguistiques des aînés portent principalement sur le lexique et aucune information n'est disponible sur la syntaxe ou sur d'autres composantes de la langue pouvant avoir été influencées par l'une ou l'autre de ces langues en contact. Sachant que des études descriptives sur chacune des langues révèlent des différences structurelles quant à l'ordre syntaxique (SVO pour l'ASL (Fischer, 1975) et le français (Sorés et Marchello-Nizia, 2005); SOV pour la LSF (Yau, 1993); SOV et OSV pour la LSQ (Bouchard et al., 1995)) et que la présence d'oralisation est fortement liée au degré d'exposition à la langue orale environnante (Plaza-Pust et Morales-López, 2008), la question de recherche de ce mémoire est : des différences grammaticales existent-elles entre le discours LSQ des sourds de groupes de femmes oralisantes, d'hommes oralisants et d'hommes signants? Les objectifs de recherche sont i) de décrire des productions LSQ de ces femmes et hommes sourds et ii) d'analyser deux cas de variation potentielle (ordre syntaxique et oralisation) dans leur production. Pour répondre à cette question, nous analysons un corpus de discours spontané en LSQ issu de 22 aînés sourds âgés de 60 ans et plus. Les résultats de cette recherche montrent que ce contexte de contact linguistique a un impact sur la fréquence de l'oralisation ainsi que sur l'ordre syntaxique dans le discours actuel des signeurs. Les femmes oralisantes montrent une influence du français et de l'ASL avec un fort taux d'oralisations et de propositions avec objet en position finale en opposition aux hommes signants oralisant moins et suivant davantage l'ordre avec verbe en finale. Les hommes oralisants produisent moins d'oralisation que les femmes, mais davantage de propositions avec objet en finale comparativement aux hommes signants. Ce mémoire ouvre donc la porte aux recherches futures en ce qu'il permet de mieux comprendre l'impact des choix didactiques sur la normalisation linguistique, ainsi que l'apport des autres langues sur la structure actuelle de la LSQ.},

New language learning results follow directly; we can explicitly calculate how many positive examples on average (“sample complexity”) it will take for a learner to correctly identify a target language with high probability. We show how sample complexity varies with input distributions and learning regimes. In particular we find that the average time to converge under reasonable language input distributions for a simple three-parameter system first described by Gibson and Wexler (1994) is psychologically plausible, in the range of 100–150 positive examples. We further find that a simple random step algorithm - that is, simply jumping from one language hypothesis to another rather than changing one parameter at a time - works faster and always converges to the right target language, in contrast to the single-step, local parameter setting method advocated in some recent work.},

However, evidence from several linguistic changes (most importantly the rise of the periphrastic auxiliary do in late Middle English) shows that the general assumption is false. Instead, at least for syntactic cases, change seems to proceed at the same rate in all contexts. Contexts change together because they are merely surface manifestations of a single underlying change in grammar. Differences in frequency of use of a new form across contexts reflect functional and stylistic factors, which are constant across time and independent of grammar.},

	abstract = {My approach to the study of language is based on the assumption that knowledge of language can be properly characterized by means of a generative grammar, i.e. a system of rules and principles that assigns structural descriptions to linguistic expressions. On this view, the basic concepts are those of 'grammar' and 'knowledge of grammar'. The concepts of 'language' and 'knowledge of language' are derivative: they involve a higher level of abstraction from psychological mechanisms and raise additional (though not necessarily important) problems. Of central concern, from this point of view, will be to determine the biological endowment that makes it possible for a grammar of the required sort to develop in human beings provided that they are exposed to some appropriate body of experience. This biological endowment may be regarded as a function that maps a body of experience into a particular grammar. The function itself is commonly referred to as universal grammar (u.g.) and can be expressed, in part, as a system of principles that determine the class of accessible particular grammars and their properties. Recent work suggests that u.g. consists, on the one hand, of a theory of so-called core grammar and, on the other, of a theory of permissible extensions and modifications of core grammar. Given the intricate internal structure of u.g., it can account for the superficially highly diverse grammars and languages that do in fact exist. Thus, what appear to be quite different systems of knowledge may arise from relatively little experience. A number of subsystems of u.g. have now been explored, each with its distinctive properties and possibilities of variation. Some current proposals concerning these systems are sketched, and some consequences considered with regard to the nature and acquisition of cognitive systems (including systems of knowledge) more generally.},

	abstract = {Social media is international: users from different cultures and language backgrounds are generating and sharing content. But language barriers emerge in the communication landscape online. In the quest for language diversity and universal access, the vision of a cosmopolitan Internet has stumbled over the language frontier.
Expatriates, minorities, diasporic communities, and language learners play an important role in forming transnational networks, creating social ties across borders. Many users of social media are multicultural and multilingual; they are mediating between language communities. In the microblogging site Twitter, information spreads across languages and countries. How are multilingual users of Twitter connecting language groups? What are the factors influencing their language choices? This research advances a step towards understanding the network structures and communication strategies that enable intercultural dialog, cross-language sharing of information, and awareness of global problems.
This dissertation research aims at: (1) exploring the ways in which multilingual users of Twitter are connecting different language groups in their social network; (2) modeling how the network influences their language choices; (3) and exploring what the textual features of their posts can elicit about language choices and mediation between groups.
This dissertation goes beyond survey information about multilingualism and provides a deeper understanding about the structural relations between language communities in Twitter. This research work is one of the few that apply social network analysis to the study of sociolinguistic questions on the Internet. Focusing on the social networks of multilingual users, this dissertation contributes an original classification of network types based on the patterns of connections between language groups. Also, it applies the novel idea of modeling the influence of network factors in the language choices of the user. Finally, this dissertation tests the hypothesis that the type of exchange influences language choice, and explores with a theme analysis how other textual features might elicit cross-cultural awareness. These results can inform the design of social media platforms.},

Nonetheless in this paper I present criteria which support the claim of ‘language-hood’ for Gurindji Kriol. I demonstrate that Gurindji Kriol (i) is a stable language variety (it has child language learners and a high degree of inter-speaker consistency), (ii) has developed independent forms and structural subsystems which have not been adopted back into the source languages, and (iii) contains structural features from both languages which is rare in other language contact varieties including Kriol/Gurindji code-switching. I also present a number of structural indicators which can be used to distinguish Gurindji Kriol mixed language clauses from code-switched clauses.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Nonce borrowings in the speech of bilinguals differ from established loanwords in that they are not necessarily recurrent, widespread, or recognized by host language monolinguals. With established loanwords, however, they share the characteristics of morphological and syntactic integration into the host language and consist of single content words or compounds. Furthermore, both types of loanwords differ from intrasentential code-switching — alternate sentence fragments in the two languages, each of which is grammatical by monolingual standards from the standpoints of appropriate function words, morphology, and syntax. In a large corpus of Tamil—English bilingual speech, many words of English origin are found in objects governed by Tamil verbs and vice versa. The equivalence constraint on intrasentential code-switching predicts that no code-switch should occur between verb and object in an SOV/SVO bilingual situation, and hence that objects whose language differs from that of the verb must be borrowed, if only for the nonce. To verify this prediction, we compare quantitatively the distribution across various syntactic contexts of both native Tamil and English—origin complements of Tamil verbs, and find them to be parallel. But the strongest evidence in favor of the nonce borrowing hypothesis comes from an analysis of variable accusative and dative case marking in these complements, in which the English-origin material is shown, morphologically and syntactically, to be virtually indistinguishable from Tamil (nonpronominal) nouns. In addition, we present supporting evidence from the genitive, locative, and other cases and from nonce borrowings from Tamil into these speakers' English.},

	abstract = {The meanings of deverbal nouns have been classified by various linguists in terms of case, such as instrument or result of action. However, there is some debate as to whether meaning can attach to the derivational suffixes such as -ation, -ment, etc., which form these nouns. For some of the meanings of the suffixes themselves are unspecified, apart from the grammatical recategorisation involved in changing a verb to a noun. Others see an affix as interacting with the base to affect the semantics of the derivative. Earlier historical linguists described deverbal suffixes as attracting a 'nexus' of meanings which are common to all of them, and which cluster round a central semantic notion such as 'action/fact'. Furthermore, it has been suggested that each suffix develops through time a unique combination of such meanings in a hierarchy of its own. This is the question I am concerned with here. My interest is in the French nominal suffixes -ment, -ance/-ence, -ation, -age and -al, which entered Middle English (ME) via borrowings from French, and which now form abstract nouns in English by attaching themselves mainly to verbs. I shall argue that from their earliest appearance in English these suffixes began to select characteristically from the nexus of common meanings, in terms both of the kinds of bases to which each suffix was characteristically attached, and also of the kinds of contexts in which words formed in it tended to appear. I further conclude that each one may specialise in a distinct aspect of the central meaning 'action/fact', such as specific instance or quality. My method has been to examine the integration into English of each suffix, then to take samples of about 200 words in each, in order to determine the semantic categories in which they were used in their earliest recorded citations in the MED and OED. Some of these contexts will be analysed in detail.},

We follow dialectometry in applying a quantitative methodology and focusing on dialect distances, and social dialectology in the choice of factors we examine in building a model to predict word pronunciation distances from the standard Dutch language to 424 Dutch dialects. We combine linear mixed-effects regression modeling with generalized additive modeling to predict the pronunciation distance of 559 words. Although geographical position is the dominant predictor, several other factors emerged as significant. The model predicts a greater distance from the standard for smaller communities, for communities with a higher average age, for nouns (as contrasted with verbs and adjectives), for more frequent words, and for words with relatively many vowels. The impact of the demographic variables, however, varied from word to word. For a majority of words, larger, richer and younger communities are moving towards the standard. For a smaller minority of words, larger, richer and younger communities emerge as driving a change away from the standard. Similarly, the strength of the effects of word frequency and word category varied geographically. The peripheral areas of the Netherlands showed a greater distance from the standard for nouns (as opposed to verbs and adjectives) as well as for high-frequency words, compared to the more central areas. Our findings indicate that changes in pronunciation have been spreading (in particular for low-frequency words) from the Hollandic center of economic power to the peripheral areas of the country, meeting resistance that is stronger wherever, for well-documented historical reasons, the political influence of Holland was reduced. Our results are also consistent with the theory of lexical diffusion, in that distances from the Hollandic norm vary systematically and predictably on a word by word basis.},

The data are drawn from two historical corpora of English texts: The Early Modern section of HCET (Helsinki Corpus of English Texts, 1500-1700), and ARCHER (A Representative Corpus of Historical English Registers, 1650-1900). The case studies are situated within an integrated theoretical framework of change in derivational morphology which addresses neologising, productivity, variation, lexicalization and semantic change. Morphological productivity, a topic typically treated in synchronic morphology, is placed at the centre of this framework. The rationale for this approach is that the measurement of productivity provides a way to observe change in progress in derivational morphology. The chief task then, is to develop procedures for measuring productivity in historical corpora. The history of the suffixes will be investigated quantitatively by measuring their productivity across temporal periods and across test-type/register, and qualitatively by analysing derived nominalizations in discourse contexts to understand the effect of register and/or text type on nominalization. The result is a socio-historical account of derived nominalization, which demonstrates the ways in which neologising (and thus productivity) can be driven by contextual factors, discourse processes and stylistic considerations.},

	abstract = {This paper argues that wordhood in the polysynthetic Inuit language is predictable from syntactic structure and that words correspond to the domains of CP and DP. This entails that Inuit's morphological component need not be any more complex than that of more isolating languages and that individual morphemes are not idiosyncratically specified as affixes. As evidence for our approach, we contrast a variety of free and bound elements, showing that in every case, subparts of words are smaller than CP/DP and full words correspond to CP/DP. We also discuss “stem” ellipsis, which we argue is further evidence that the elements which are usually bound in Inuit are not genuinely affixes.},

A model for the turn-taking organization for conversation is proposed, and is examined for its compatibility with a list of grossly observable facts about conversation. The results of the examination suggest that, at least, a model for turn-taking in conversation will be characterized as locally managed, party-administered, interactionally controlled, and sensitive to recipient design. Several general consequences of the model are explicated, and contrasts are sketched with turn-taking organizations for other speech-exchange systems.},

Taking data from African American Vernacular English variable copula absence as a case study, I argue that syntactic constraints and social meaning are intertwined. I present an overview of the literature on social meaning, discuss what grammars are models of, and argue that in order to model socially meaningful variation, competence grammars need to be extended to include social meaning, precompiled phrases, and probabilistic or frequentistic information. I then explore different heuristics for defining the boundaries of competence grammar and discuss the commonalities between the proposed additions and the kind of linguistic knowledge which is generally assumed to comprise competence grammar.},

The data show lexical variability at a finer scale than has usually been considered in American dialectology, and show variation that appears independent of both region and class in its patterning.

A comparison of the distribution of variants and of the conditioning factors reveals that Acadian and Laurentian varieties have different future temporal reference systems. The Baie Sainte-Marie variety retains vestiges of earlier stages of the grammaticalization of one of the variants, the periphrastic future, not found in other Acadian varieties, thus supporting its characterization as a conservative variety.},

The contributions which sociolinguistics could make in return to the African American speech community -- but has not done sufficiently -- include the induction of African Americans into linguistics, the representation of African Americans in our writings, and involvement in courts, workplaces, and schools, especially with respect to the teaching of reading and the language arts. This last issue has surged to public attention following the Oakland School Board's "Ebonics" resolutions on Dec. 18, 1996. The present unequal partnership between researcher and researched is widespread within linguistics.

	abstract = {This dissertation examines variation in mood choice and in the expression of future temporal reference in a conservative variety of Acadian French. The data come from two sociolinguistic corpora representative of the variety spoken in the Baie Sainte-Marie area of southwest Nova Scotia. Since varieties of Acadian French preserve features lost in most other contemporary varieties, they offer a unique opportunity to study linguistic systems closely related to earlier stages of the language.
The methodological and theoretical approaches involve both variationist sociolinguistics and generative theories of grammar, thus combining two areas of research not usually brought together. The study focuses on two linguistic variables: 1) use of the subjunctive vs. other moods (indicative and conditional), and 2) expression of future temporal reference (inflected future vs. periphrastic future). The analysis of the subjunctive shows that there is actually little variation and the subjunctive mood is well preserved. The variation which is observed can be accounted for by assuming that mood choice turns on the presence or absence of a semantic feature, assertion. The results for the future temporal reference variable show, contrary to what has been found for Laurentian varieties, that the inflected future remains in robust use, with the strongest predictor of variant choice being temporal reference, with proximate actions favouring the periphrastic future. The future results are in line with both prior studies of Acadian French and with grammarians' characterization of the latter variant as le futur proche. The results also differ from those of studies of Laurentian varieties in that sentential polarity plays no role in conditioning variant choice. The formal analysis accounts for variation by positing two loci of variation (one pre-syntax and one post-syntax) which accurately predicts the observed frequencies of the variants.
Overall, this dissertation shows that while there may be variable usage there is no evidence of change in the linguistic system for these two variables, thus supporting the characterization of this variety of Acadian French as conservative. The formal analyses contribute to an emerging line of research, sometimes referred to as sociosyntax, which aims at accounting for variation-within the grammar.},

However, there have been few studies of the phenomenon actually in progress. This article describes the development of a new variety in the English New Town of Milton Keynes, designated in 1967. The article is structured around eight "principles" that relate the process of koineization to its outcomes. Recordings were made of 48 Milton Keynes-born children in three age groups (4, 8, and 12), the principal caregiver of each child, and several elderly locally born residents. Quantitative analysis of ten phonetic variables suggests that substantial but not complete focusing occurs in the child generation. The lack of linguistic continuity in the New Town is demonstrated, and the time scale of koineization there is discussed. Finally, it is shown that demography and the social-network characteristics of individuals are crucial to the outcomes of koineization.},

	abstract = {This thesis concerns Chiac, a dialect of Acadian French (AF) that emerged in a small speech community of AF-English bilingual teenagers in Moncton, Canada. Syntactically and morphologically, Chiac closely resembles AF, but it also makes use of a number of English lexical items and other English-influenced constructions. This thesis addresses two related questions with regard to Chiac: how (and why) did it emerge, and what is its structure?
I answer the first question in Chapters 2--3, arguing that Chiac emerged as a result of a confluence of social factors. Speakers' age, their bilingualism, their urban environment and their attitudes toward the languages spoken in Moncton resulted in speakers sharing a sense of identity and wanting to distinguish themselves from other social groups. Within the framework of Cognitive Grammar (CG) I model the emergence of Chiac due to these social factors. The advantage of a CG approach is that, in addition to allowing for a unified analysis of how social factors influence linguistic structure, it treats the bilingual linguistic system in the same way as the monolingual linguistic system in that no special modules or formal devices are needed to account for bilingual language usage.
Chapters 4--6 address the second question: what is the structure of Chiac? Still using the framework of CG I describe the Chiac lexicon, as well as some of its noun phrase and verb phrase constructions. I find, for example, that English-based lexical items in Chiac tend to involve certain semantic domains related to teen culture (drugs, social groups at school etc.). The motivation for this usage seems to be that speakers' adolescence is highly relevant to their sense of identity, and that mixing English with their parents' language (AF) is a way of asserting that identity.
This thesis therefore has both theoretical and descriptive relevance in that, in addition to describing specific constructions, I show how constructions and ultimately an entire system emerged as a result of language mixing that is motivated by social factors.},

In this article I argue that this model is also quite appropriate to analyze not only the emergence of a semantic convention, but also its change. I delineate how the application of signaling games helps to reproduce and depict mechanisms of semantic change. For that purpose I present a model that combines a signaling game with innovative reinforcement learning; in simulation runs I conduct this game repeatedly within a multi-agent setup, where agents are arranged in social network structures. The results of these runs are contrasted with an attested theory from sociolinguistics: the ‘weak tie’ theory. Analyses of the produced data target a deeper understanding of the role of environmental variables for the promotion of (1) semantic change or (2) solidity of semantic conventions.},

Further, we analyse these relationships in the presence of biases in cultural learning and find that the introduction of new variants typically increases cultural diversity substantially in the short term, but may decrease long-term diversity. Independent invention generally supports higher levels of cultural diversity than refinement. Repeated patterns of innovation through refinement generate characteristic oscillating trends in diversity, with increasing trends towards greater average diversity observed for medium but not low innovation rates. Conformity weakens the relationship between innovation and diversity. The level of cultural diversity, and pattern of temporal dynamics, potentially provide clues as to the underlying process, which can be used to interpret empirical data.},

Fluid Communities is based on the propagation methodology, which represents the state-of-the-art in terms of computational cost and scalability. While being highly efficient, Fluid Communities is able to find communities in synthetic graphs with an accuracy close to the current best alternatives. Additionally, Fluid Communities is the first propagation-based algorithm capable of identifying a variable number of communities in network. To illustrate the relevance of the algorithm, we evaluate the diversity of the communities found by Fluid Communities, and find them to be significantly different from the ones found by alternative methods.},

	abstract = {People learn language from their social environment. As individuals differ in their social networks, they might be exposed to input with different lexical distributions, and these might influence their linguistic representations and lexical choices. In this article we test the relation between linguistic performance and 3 social network properties that should influence input variability, namely, network size, network heterogeneity, and network density. In particular, we examine how these social network properties influence lexical prediction, lexical access, and lexical use. To do so, in Study 1, participants predicted how people of different ages would name pictures, and in Study 2 participants named the pictures themselves. In both studies, we examined how participants’ social network properties related to their performance. In Study 3, we ran simulations on norms we collected to see how age variability in one’s network influences the distribution of different names in the input. In all studies, network age heterogeneity influenced performance leading to better prediction, faster response times for difficult-to-name items, and less entropy in input distribution. These results suggest that individual differences in social network properties can influence linguistic behavior. Specifically, they show that having a more heterogeneous network is associated with better performance. These results also show that the same factors influence lexical prediction and lexical production, suggesting the two might be related.},

We find that the frequency of airline flights between the two parties is the best predictor of Twitter ties. This highlights the importance of looking at pre-existing ties between places and people.},

Research trends in recent decades have seen a great volume of publishing in regards to the methods of language documentation, however, it is not clear that linguists' awareness of the importance of robust data-collection methods is translating into transparency about those methods or data citation in resultant publications. We analyze 50 dissertations and 50 grammars from a ten-year span (2003-2012) to assess the current state of the field. Publications are critiqued on the basis of transparency of data collection methods, analysis and storage, as well as citation of primary data. While we found examples of transparent reporting in these areas, much of the surveyed research does not include key information about methodology or data. We acknowledge that descriptive linguists often practice good methodology in data collection, but as a field we need to build a better culture with regard to making this clear in research writing. Thus we conclude with suggested benchmarks for the kind of information we believe is vital for creating a rich and useful research methodology in both long and short format descriptive research writing.},

The model allows us to predict for which scenarios of intervention language maintenance is more likely to be achieved.

The present paper creates a social network threshold model of the diffusion of innovations based on the Ryan and Gross (1943) adopter categories: (1) early adopters; (2) early majority; (3) late majority; (4) laggards. This new model uses social networks as a basis for adopter categorization, instead of solely relying on the system-level analysis used previously. The present paper argues that these four adopter categories can be created either with respect to the entire social system, or with respect to an individual's personal network. This dual typology is used to analyze three diffusion datasets to show how external influence and opinion leadership channel the diffusion of innovations. Network thresholds can be used (1) to vary the definition of behavioral contagion, (2) to predict the pattern of diffusion of innovations, and (3) to identify opinion leaders and followers in order to understand the two-step flow hypothesis better.},

Several forms of HARKing are identified and survey data are presented that suggests that at least some forms of HARKing are widely practiced and widely seen as inappropriate. I identify several reasons why scientists might HARK. Then I discuss several reasons why scientists ought not to HARK. It is conceded that the question of whether HARKing's costs exceed its benefits is a complex one that ought to be addressed through research, open discussion, and debate.

In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem.

Network research in sociolinguistics suggests that integration in a local community network promotes speakers' retention of local linguistic variants in the context of pressure from external or standard dialects. In most sociolinguistic network research, a speaker is assigned a single score along an index representing the aggregate of several network and other social features. We propose that contemporary network methods in adjacent disciplines can profitably apply to sociolinguistics, thereby facilitating not only more generalizable quantitative analysis but also new questions about the relational nature of linguistic variables. Two network analysis methods—cohesive blocking and Quadratic Assignment Procedure regression—are used to evaluate the social network factors shaping the retreat from the Southern Vowel Shift (SVS) in Raleigh, North Carolina. The data come from a 160-speaker subset of a conversational corpus. Significant network effects indicate that network proximity to Raleigh's urban core promotes retention of SVS features, and that network similarity between speakers corresponds to linguistic similarity. Contemporary social-network methods can contribute to linguistic analysis by providing a holistic picture of the community's structure.

Bd, 2, 125?154) Specificity Hypothesis ? ?Embedded language elements in code-switching have a high degree of semantic specificity? (p. 128).Approach:Adopting a concept-based approach to examine loanwords in a large, reliable corpus, the study pursues the following question: Do loanwords have a high degree of semantic specificity relative to their receiving-language equivalents? Specificity is operationalized as an entropy measure of the target word?s environment, the assumption being that more specific words have less variety in their surrounding context.Data and analysis:To test this hypothesis, Anglicisms in a 24-million-word newspaper corpus of Argentine Spanish were processed in three stages: detecting loanwords, selecting semantic equivalents, and measuring specificity.Findings/conclusions:A Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test revealed that loanwords receive significantly lower entropy scores, that is, they are more specific than their Spanish equivalents. The results suggest a possible motive for adopting loanwords when terms already exist in the source language, namely, to utilize words that provide more nuanced meaning.Originality:Methodologically, this study offers innovative applications of computational methods to loanword research, employing a distributional model to measure entropy. Theoretically, it addresses an underrepresented aspect of loanword adoption, semantics, by extending Backus?s hypothesis to loanwords and increasing its scope to data often viewed as ?monolingual?.Significance/implications:The conclusions offer novel perspectives on loanwords with existing semantic equivalents, often viewed as ?unnecessary? when compared to loanwords that introduce new concepts into the recipient language (e.g. blog). With the notion of specificity, we may understand these loanwords as disruptors to the semantic system of the recipient language, dividing up the semantic space formerly occupied solely by the native equivalent, thus increasing the level of nuance expressed in the original concept.},

In addition, we proposed a cognitive plasticity framework to account for cognitive differences and similarities between trilinguals and bilinguals.Data and analysis:Three aspects of cognition were analyzed: (1) cognitive reserve in older adults, as measured by age of onset of Alzheimer?s disease and mild cognitive impairment; (2) inhibitory control in children and younger adults, as measured by response times on behavioral Simon and flanker tasks; and (3) memory generalization in infants and toddlers, as measured by accuracy on behavioral deferred imitation tasks. Results were considered within a framework of cognitive plasticity, which took into account several factors that may affect plasticity including the age of learning a third language and the extent to which additional cognitive resources are needed to learn the third language.Findings:A mixed pattern of results was observed. In some cases, such as cognitive reserve in older adults, trilinguals showed larger advantages than did bilinguals. On other measures, for example inhibitory control in children and younger adults, trilinguals were found to exhibit the same advantages as bilinguals. In still other cases, such as memory generalization in infants and toddlers, trilinguals did not demonstrate the advantages seen in bilinguals.Originality:This study is the first comprehensive analysis of how learning a third language affects the cognitive abilities that are modified by bilingual experience, and the first to propose a cognitive plasticity framework that can explain and predict trilingual-bilingual differences.Significance:This research shows that the cognitive consequences of trilingualism are not simply an extension of bilingualism?s effects; rather, trilingualism has distinct consequences, with theoretical implications for our understanding of linguistic and cognitive processes and their plasticity, as well as applied-science implications for using second and third language learning in educational and rehabilitative contexts to foster successful cognitive development and aging.},

Participants’ connections to Chalmette were measured in two ways: (1) post-Katrina location status, i.e. whether participants returned or relocated after the storm; (2) place orientation, captured via an ethnographically informed, multifaceted measure of stance and exposure to places outside of Chalmette. Analysis revealed that place orientation better predicts rates of r-lessness than post-Katrina location.

The role of social networks in language variation has been studied using a wide range of metrics. This study critically examines the effect of different dimensions of networks on different aspects of language variation. Three dimensions of personal network (ethnicity, nationality, diversity) are evaluated in relation to three levels of language structure (phonetic form, accent range, language choice) over three generations of British Asians. The results indicate a scaling of network influences. The two metrics relating to qualities of an individual's ties are more historically and culturally specific, whereas the network metric that relates to the structure of an individual's social world appears to exert a more general effect on accent repertoires across generations. This two-tier typology—network qualities (more culturally contingent) and network structures (more general)—facilitates an integrated understanding of previous studies and a more structured methodology for studying the effect of social networks on language.},

Are phonological variables transferred to writing on the level of graphemes, or is the larger system of contextual patterning also transferred? This paper considers orthographic coda deletions corresponding to the phonological variables of (ing) and (t,d). In both cases, orthography mirrors speech: reduction of the -ing suffix depends on the word's syntactic category, and reduction of the -t,-d suffix depends on the succeeding phonological context. These spellings are more frequently used in informal conversational contexts, and in areas with high proportions of African Americans, again mirroring the patterning of the associated phonological variables. This suggests a deep connection between variation in the two modalities, necessitating a new account of the production of cross-modal variation.},

Despite this striking assumption, many recent studies have sought to assess whether neutrality can provide a good description of different episodes of cultural change. One approach has been to test whether neutral predictions are consistent with observed progeny distributions, recording the number of variants that have produced a given number of new instances within a specified time interval: a classic example is the distribution of baby names. Using an overlapping generations model we show that these distributions consist of two phases: a power law phase with a constant exponent of -3/2, followed by an exponential cut-off for variants with very large numbers of progeny. Maximum likelihood estimations of the model parameters provide a direct way to establish whether observed empirical patterns are consistent with neutral evolution. We apply our approach to a complete data set of baby names from Australia. Crucially we show that analyses based on only the most popular variants, as is often the case in studies of cultural evolution, can provide misleading evidence for underlying transmission hypotheses. While neutrality provides a plausible description of progeny distributions of abundant variants, rare variants deviate from neutrality. Further, we develop a simulation framework that allows for the detection of alternative cultural transmission processes. We show that anti-novelty bias is able to replicate the complete progeny distribution of the Australian data set.},

Our results provide a striking validation of the incrementation model, confirming its value as a key to understanding the evolution of linguistic systems. However, although our findings reveal the predicted peak in the apparent-time progress of a change and corroborate the female tendency to lead innovation, there is no absolute contrast between men and women with respect to incrementation. Instead, quantitative differences in the social embedding of linguistic change correlate with the rate of the change in the speech community.},

(CE)—(æ) Retraction and Lowering (e.g., mad,
pat) and (aw) Fronting (e.g., loud,
mouse)— with a view to discovering the routes by which
phonological change diffuses. The data are from St. John's,
Newfoundland, one of the few remaining Canadian communities where the
variety spoken by the founding population remains relatively intact.
Because this variety is leveling toward CE (Clarke,
1991), the St. John's context enables us to tap into processes
of dialect shift while they are taking place. This glimpse reveals the
developmental nature of linguistic constraints during the early stages of
change. Moreover, by focusing on preadolescent and adolescent speakers,
age groups that are often overlooked in favor of adult samples (Eckert, 1988:183), the analysis situates the locus of
change on the adolescent years. Taken together, these results provide an
important gauge for tracking the progress of phonological change.Special thanks to Jack Chambers, Sandra Clarke,

Here we examine the communication patterns of millions of mobile phone users, allowing us to simultaneously study the local and the global structure of a society-wide communication network. We observe a coupling between interaction strengths and the network's local structure, with the counterintuitive consequence that social networks are robust to the removal of the strong ties but fall apart after a phase transition if the weak ties are removed. We show that this coupling significantly slows the diffusion process, resulting in dynamic trapping of information in communities and find that, when it comes to information diffusion, weak and strong ties are both simultaneously ineffective.},

However, due to its unique complexity, the mechanism of the diffusion in online social networks is different from the ones in other types of networks and remains unclear to us. Meanwhile, few works have been done to reveal the coupled dynamics of both the structure and the diffusion of online social networks. To this end, in this paper, we propose a model to investigate how the structure is coupled with the diffusion in online social networks from the view of weak ties. Through numerical experiments on large-scale online social networks, we find that in contrast to some previous research results, selecting weak ties preferentially to republish cannot make the information diffuse quickly, while random selection can achieve this goal. However, when we remove the weak ties gradually, the coverage of the information will drop sharply even in the case of random selection. We also give a reasonable explanation for this by extra analysis and experiments. Finally, we conclude that weak ties play a subtle role in the information diffusion in online social networks. On one hand, they act as bridges to connect isolated local communities together and break through the local trapping of the information. On the other hand, selecting them as preferential paths to republish cannot help the information spread further in the network. As a result, weak ties might be of use in the control of the virus spread and the private information diffusion in real-world applications.},

We examine the largest connected component of the sub graph formed by retaining only edges in cliques, and apply partitioning strategies that explicitly minimise the number of cliques split. We conclude that, due to the connectedness of many networks, any community finding algorithm that produces partitions must fail to find at least some significant structures.

	abstract = {The modern science of networks has brought significant advances to our understanding of complex systems. One of the most relevant features of graphs representing real systems is community structure, or clustering, i.e. the organization of vertices in clusters, with many edges joining vertices of the same cluster and comparatively few edges joining vertices of different clusters. Such clusters, or communities, can be considered as fairly independent compartments of a graph, playing a similar role like, e.g., the tissues or the organs in the human body. Detecting communities is of great importance in sociology, biology and computer science, disciplines where systems are often represented as graphs. This problem is very hard and not yet satisfactorily solved, despite the huge effort of a large interdisciplinary community of scientists working on it over the past few years. We will attempt a thorough exposition of the topic, from the definition of the main elements of the problem, to the presentation of most methods developed, with a special focus on techniques designed by statistical physicists, from the discussion of crucial issues like the significance of clustering and how methods should be tested and compared against each other, to the description of applications to real networks.},

In practice, one typically chooses an objective function that captures the intuition of a network cluster as set of nodes with better internal connectivity than external connectivity, and then one applies approximation algorithms or heuristics to extract sets of nodes that are related to the objective function and that "look like" good communities for the application of interest. In this paper, we explore a range of network community detection methods in order to compare them and to understand their relative performance and the systematic biases in the clusters they identify. We evaluate several common objective functions that are used to formalize the notion of a network community, and we examine several different classes of approximation algorithms that aim to optimize such objective functions. In addition, rather than simply fixing an objective and asking for an approximation to the best cluster of any size, we consider a size-resolved version of the optimization problem. Considering community quality as a function of its size provides a much finer lens with which to examine community detection algorithms, since objective functions and approximation algorithms often have non-obvious size-dependent behavior., Related Persons: Rappa, Michael ; Jones, Paul ; Freire, Juliana ; Chakrabarti, Soumen},

After considering community-level detection performance measured by normalized mutual information, the Omega index, and node-level detection performance measured by F-score, we reached the following conclusions. For low overlapping density networks, SLPA, OSLOM, Game, and COPRA offer better performance than the other tested algorithms. For networks with high overlapping density and high overlapping diversity, both SLPA and Game provide relatively stable performance. However, test results also suggest that the detection in such networks is still not yet fully resolved. A common feature observed by various algorithms in real-world networks is the relatively small fraction of overlapping nodes (typically less than 30\%), each of which belongs to only 2 or 3 communities.},

Results indicate that some measures are more stable than others, and that stability is also a function of network and study properties.},

The measures are created using a reverse distance (geodesic) matrix, thus providing a directed closeness measure. Integration and radiality are then correlated with other centrality measures to examine the differences and similarities between each other and these other centrality measures. We then show how integration and radiality are associated with certain demographic and substantive variables. Integration and radiality provide a new index of network structure and our results show how that structure may influence behavior.},

	abstract = {Twitter, a microblogging service less than three years old, commands more than 41 million users as of July 2009 and is growing fast. Twitter users tweet about any topic within the 140-character limit and follow others to receive their tweets. The goal of this paper is to study the topological characteristics of Twitter and its power as a new medium of information sharing.

We have crawled the entire Twitter site and obtained 41.7 million user profiles, 1.47 billion social relations, 4,262 trending topics, and 106 million tweets. In its follower-following topology analysis we have found a non-power-law follower distribution, a short effective diameter, and low reciprocity, which all mark a deviation from known characteristics of human social networks [28]. In order to identify influentials on Twitter, we have ranked users by the number of followers and by PageRank and found two rankings to be similar. Ranking by retweets differs from the previous two rankings, indicating a gap in influence inferred from the number of followers and that from the popularity of one's tweets. We have analyzed the tweets of top trending topics and reported on their temporal behavior and user participation. We have classified the trending topics based on the active period and the tweets and show that the majority (over 85\%) of topics are headline news or persistent news in nature. A closer look at retweets reveals that any retweeted tweet is to reach an average of 1,000 users no matter what the number of followers is of the original tweet. Once retweeted, a tweet gets retweeted almost instantly on next hops, signifying fast diffusion of information after the 1st retweet.

To the best of our knowledge this work is the first quantitative study on the entire Twittersphere and information diffusion on it.},

Researchers have concentrated particularly on a few properties that seem to be common to many networks: the small-world property, power-law degree distributions, and network transitivity. In this article, we highlight another property that is found in many networks, the property of community structure, in which network nodes are joined together in tightly knit groups, between which there are only looser connections. We propose a method for detecting such communities, built around the idea of using centrality indices to find community boundaries. We test our method on computer-generated and real-world graphs whose community structure is already known and find that the method detects this known structure with high sensitivity and reliability. We also apply the method to two networks whose community structure is not well known-a collaboration network and a food web- and find that it detects significant and informative community divisions in both cases.},

The traditional membership borders of what a community consists of no longer apply in the case of Cajun. In order to understand these questions of identity and belonging, and to scientifically control the interpretation of the linguistic behavior of Cajun speakers, a general survey has been conducted on the linguistic attitudes and cultural identity of a sample of 929 individuals stratified by age and sex from four communities. Our results show that Cajun identity rests fundamentally in the linguistic ability of the speakers, regardless of the age group one Is In: the more one has access to the Cajun language, the more one self-identifies as Cajun. In general, respondents claim that the necessary criteria to be considered Cajun are just those criteria that they themselves satisfy We will demonstrate that there appear to be several 'paths' to take insofar as the Cajun community identity in Louisiana is concerned. However, this segmentation obviously has not been established or maintained without creating considerable tension between members of the cultural Cajun community.},

	url = {http://search.proquest.com/docview/304976615/},
	abstract = {This dissertation examines the adaptation of loanwords in natural speech based on loanword data from sociolinguistic interviews with native French speakers in Montréal. The Francophone sample was supplemented with interviews with native Spanish-speaking Montrealers, to examine the influence of bilinguals, often reported to be the introducers of borrowings. The social and linguistic factors favoring adaptation as opposed to importation of foreign segments are considered, and within the category of adaptation, the extent to which this adaptation is phonetic vs. phonological is explored. Acoustic analysis of the vowels reveals that the patterns observed lend support to both phonetic and phonological approaches. Some surprising patterns are discovered, notably the adaptation of English /æ/, which exhibits prenasal tensing. Phonetic and social explanations for this result are proposed. For consonants, the adaptation patterns of /r/ and /h/ are found to be conditioned by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, individual speakers' linguistic ability. Throughout the analysis, limited evidence is found for the influence of neighborhood bilingualism, with individual bilingualism being the predominant determining factor for segment importation in the loanword data, in addition to earliest attestation date, frequency, and sometimes additional social factors. The predominance of individual bilingualism over community bilingualism is explained by the social composition of Montréal, as well as the distribution of the present sample in terms of social characteristics. Finally, in the analysis of the Hispanophone sample, it is found that while bilinguals influence the variants' rate of use, they do not affect the grammatical constraints applying to each of the variants, suggesting a solution to the question of the particular role of bilinguals. This study elucidates many of the complex and multifaceted issues related to loanword adaptation, serving as a contribution to several fields of linguistics, including sociolinguistics, phonology, phonetics, and the study of language contact. This dissertation also contributes to the growing body of knowledge about the linguistic behavior of the multilingual speech community of Montréal.},

These regions are not coterminous with traditional North American dialect regions; rather, they align with patterns of movement during the Great Migrations.},

The analyses also focus on how speakers deploy and take up stances vis-a-vis sociolinguistic variables and the critical role of stance in the processes of indexicalization: how linguistic forms come to be associated with social categories and meanings. In doing so, many of the authors address critical issues of power and social reproduction, examining how stance is implicated in the production, reproduction and potential change of social and linguistic hierarchies and ideologies. This volume maps out the terrain of existing sociolinguistic and linguistic anthropological research on stance, synthesizes how it relates to existing theoretical orientations, and identifies a framework for future research.},

The speech behaviors of these respondents with respect to variants of six linguistic variables (each with a black English [BE] and a colloquial Standard English variant) are quantified and the statistical relationships between the VCI scores and linguistic behavior are determined. The results of the study reveal that respondents in the older age groups (40-59, 60+) are more likely to choose BE variants than respondents in the younger age groups (18-25, 26-39), and that there are consistent statistically significant correlations between high scores on the VCI and the choice of BE variants of the linguistic variables. This is taken to support the proposal that the Social Network Theory approach, of which the VCI concept is a part, is capable of explaining intracommunity linguistic variation in socioeconomically homogeneous areas such as the black community studied.},

	abstract = {Many researchers have investigated the copula for
possible links between African American Vernacular English
(aave) and Atlantic Creoles, a connection that has served as
the foundation of the Creolist Hypothesis in the on-going debate over
the origins of aave. One variety that has been of particular
interest in this debate is Gullah, which has been hypothetically linked
to aave since some of the earliest statements of the Creolist
Hypothesis. To date, however, very little research has been done on
copula variability in Gullah itself. This study, therefore, provides an
analysis of copula variability in present affirmative contexts in
Gullah. Variation is found among full, contracted, and zero forms in
1st person singular, plural/2nd person singular, and 3rd person
singular environments. The analysis also reveals some parallels between
Gullah and aave that offer support for the theory of an
aave/creole connection.I
would like to acknowledge the Department of Linguistics and the Center
for African Studies at Ohio State University for covering the cost of
some of the fieldwork for this study. I would also like to acknowledge
the McKissick Museum at the University of South Carolina for providing
several hours of recordings used for the study. My sincerest thanks to

In multiple studies, researchers claim one variable as (a) particularly decisive and correlative for a number of phenomena and (b) almost universally applicable: the social network structure (Milroy, ). This article summarizes previous work incorporating network theory in questions of language change and discusses a practice noticeably absent from classical sociolinguistics: the simulation of language change. In  simulation experiments, sociolinguistic theories of language change – especially those employing social network structure – can be tested in a virtual society free from the hindrance of data sparseness. In this context, the model of game theory can be utilized to construct individuals' interaction for more robust and feasible results.},

Experimental evidence is provided that this substantially increases the range of networks for which centrality analysis is feasible. The betweenness centrality index is essential in the analysis of social networks, but costly to compute. Currently, the fastest known algorithms require ?(n 3) time and ?(n 2) space, where n is the number of actors in the network.},

In Experiments 1 and 2, Dutch–English bilinguals code-switched in describing pictures while being cued with word orders that are either shared or not shared between Dutch and English. In Experiments 3 and 4, the same task was embedded in a confederate-scripted dialogue situation, and the confederate’s use of word order and sentence position of switching was manipulated. We found that participants had a clear preference for using the shared word order when they switched languages, but also aligned their word order choices and code-switching patterns with the confederate. These findings demonstrate how the integration of languages in sentence production depends on processes of syntactic co-activation between languages and on processes of alignment between dialogue partners, and extend the notion of interactive alignment to bilingual speech and code-switching.},

	abstract = {This paper integrates aspects of both generative theory and variationist sociolinguistics. To compare the structure of two varieties of French (Acadian French and Laurentian French), I adapt the comparative sociolinguistics approach to compare the syntactic structure of these varieties. Specifically, I focus on the effects of a single linguistic constraint across multiple sociolinguistic variables. I argue that such a comparison provides insights into the underlying grammatical structures of the varieties under comparison, differences that may have remained hidden otherwise. To illustrate the approach, I focus on a single constraint, sentential polarity, and I analyze its effects on two sociolinguistic variables, yes/no questions and future temporal reference. Results show that the polarity constraint is operative in Laurentian French for both variables, but inoperative in Acadian French. To account for this difference, I argue that Laurentian French negative structures involve a negative head above the tense phrase while Acadian French does not.},

It focuses on media representations of Chiac, a traditionally low-status variety of Acadian French. We consider performances of this variety in the adventures of an animated superhero, Acadieman, presented in a cable TV show running on Rogers TV from 2005 to 2009. We first contextualize Acadieman in terms of the linguistic and cultural contexts in which Chiac is spoken. We then consider how particular social meanings are created through contrasts between Chiac-speaking characters and speakers of other varieties. While the juxtaposition of varieties is at one level quite humorous, on another level it draws on complex indexicalities and valorizes the local variety and, by extension, its speakers. Finally, we argue that the Acadieman phenomenon provides a discursive space within which present-day Acadian identities can be negotiated. (English)},

In previous investigations breathing kinematics, subglottal pressures, and voice source characteristics of a group of premier country singers have been analyzed. The present study complements the description of these singers' voice properties by examining the formant frequencies in five of these country singers' spoken and sung versions of the national anthem and of a song of their own choosing. The formant frequencies were measured for identical phonemes under both conditions. Comparisons revealed that the singers used the same or slightly higher formant frequencies when they were singing than when they were speaking. The differences may be related to the higher fundamental frequency in singing. These findings are in good agreement with previous observations regarding breathing, subglottal pressures, and voice source, but are in marked contrast to what has been found for classically trained singers.},

Instead, local binding has three compositional sources. Morphological economy (Burzio 1989) construes an object pronoun reflexively just if no morphologically reflexive expression has the same agreement features. This elsewhere-type principle, generally satisfied in Haitian, applies only exceptionally in French and English, creating surface anaphor/pronoun complementarity as the predominant pattern in those languages (Bouchard 1984). Referential economy (Pica 1987) "anaphorizes" a possessive DP headed by an inalienably possessed noun such as tèt 'head' or kò 'body'. Inherent reflexivity licenses a null internal argument with an inalienably possessed lexical constant BODY. The necessity of all three mechanisms in Haitian argues for the reduction of the LGB binding conditions (Chomsky 1981) to the "On Binding" framework (Chomsky 1980).},

This paper argues that even SC, a language without articles, projects a DP on top of NPs in argument positions. The strongest evidence comes from noun/pronoun asymmetries, where the pronouns precede, and nouns follow, certain intensifying adjectives. Assuming that these adjectives occupy a fixed syntactic position, the conclusion must be that pronouns occupy a structurally higher position than nouns. Since the evidence of such asymmetries is extremely sparse in the data, the children presumably cannot rely on them to conclude that there is a DP in SC. Since there are also no articles in SC, children have virtually no evidence of the existence of a DP. It must be then that the projection of DPs is a universal property, independent of the presence of the lexical item which solely occupies the head of the projection. Morphological properties of SC pronouns and adjectives actually support the existence of more than just one functional projection in the noun phrase in SC. The paper derives Greenberg's universal 43, which states that pronouns are more likely to have (gender) morphology than nouns, by arguing that pronouns move (overtly) through more functional projections than nouns, and ultimately land in D.},

(a) Spell-out rules for pronouns may target nonterminal categories. (b) Pro drop is zero spell-out (i.e., deletion) of regular pronouns. (c) Competition between spell-out rules is governed by the Elsewhere Principle. A full derivation relies on an acquisitional strategy motivated by the absence of negative evidence. We test our proposal using data from a sample of twenty languages and The World Atlas of Language Structures (Haspelmath et al. 2005).},

	abstract = {This paper provides support for the claim that there are two functional projections in full noun phrases, Determiner Phrase (DP) and Number Phrase (NumP), based on an analysis of the dual marker in Modern Hebrew. The assumption of two nominal functional categories permits a structural account of differences in the distribution of elements that function as first/second person pronouns and those that function as third person pronouns. It is hypothesized that 1st/2nd person pronouns are DPs which contain only the head D and that this head is specified for person, number and gender. In contrast, 3rd person pronouns have a more complex structure, where D is specified for person and Num is specified for number and gender. Similarities between past tense agreement and 1st/2nd person pronouns on the one hand and between present tense agreement and 3rd person pronouns on the other suggest that the same nominal functional categories that act as pronouns also act as agreement. In other words, the difference between pronouns and agreement lies not in their category, but in their role in the syntax. Finally, this view of pronouns and agreement is applied to complex null subject phenomena in Modern Hebrew. In order to account for the fact that the distribution of null subjects varies across persons and across tenses, we propose a matching condition on both the category and content of the null pronoun and agreement.},

British English do has some characteristics of a fully deleted phrase, and some of a pro-form. The paper proposes that deletion is involved in this construction, but of a smaller constituent than can host wh-movement or long quantifier-raising. Therefore, deletion must occur within the syntax, in order to bleed syntactic processes. It is further shown that, within a phase-based syntax, Voice must be a phase rather than v, but that both functional heads must exist, and offers a new explanation for the incompatibility of passive and British English do, as well as an account of why some languages, like English, lack impersonal passives, while others, such as Dutch, allow them.},

This proposal accounts for why plural-marked nouns are construed as definite unless an overt marker of indefiniteness appears, and why plural marking does not cooccur with numerals unless the noun phrase is definite. It is also shown that the indefinite marker in Persian is quantitative rather than cardinal and is thus associated with higher functional structure within the noun phrase than in English. In English, on the other hand, number marking, the indefinite article, and the grammatical distinction between count and mass nouns, are all realized at the level of NumP. Differences in the interpretation of bare noun phrases in English and Persian are therefore explained by the claim that argument noun phrases must minimally be NumPs in English while Persian lacks this projection altogether.},

I argue that jeder consists of three overt morphemes je-d-er, which are heads in an extended adjectival projection (xAP). Their relative order is derived by movement [xAPje d er tjeP]. Je corresponds to the adjectival stem, -d- is an adjectival article (which in turn is analyzed as a relative complementizer) and -er is an agreement head, AgrA. The xAP further contains movement traces/ copies of the nominal which jeder quantifies over. One of these copies is in the complement of je where, I claim, it supplies the restriction (distributive key or range). The components of the proposal are all motivated independently of jeder: (i) the morphology of jeder identifies it as adjectival, hence an analysis of it must incorporate an (independently motivated) adjectival syntax; (ii) a comparison with the distributive dual quantifier beid- ‘both’ further informs the syntactic analysis internal to the word jeder; and (iii) a comparison of je in jeder and in other je-words suggests that je takes an N(P) complement, a fact that confirms the expectations regarding the selectional properties of je raised by the preceding discussion. Finally, a comparison of jeder with counterparts of it in other languages, as well as with other complex determiners in German, will broaden the scope and corroborate important aspects of the present proposal.},

	abstract = {C agrees in the φ-features of an operator in its Spec but not one in situ in many Bantu languages. Despite this I argue that a closest c-command based account (Chomsky 2000) is superior to a Spec-head agreement analysis, for two reasons. First, feature-valuation under closest c-command permits a unified treatment of Bantu operator agreement and West Germanic complementizer agreement with subjects. Second, it explains a common requirement that subjects be in situ in Bantu A′-movement constructions: a subject raised to Spec, TP would intervene between C's φ-features and the operator in outer Spec, vP that must value them. Like wh-movement, subject raising always coincides with agreement in Bantu; I propose that Bantu uninterpretable φ-features have EPP features. These are distinct from the classical EPP of T which, I argue, underlies a verbal agreement requirement giving every Bantu inflectional category a specifier. I show that nominative Case-checking is independent of both agreement and EPP in Bantu.},

	abstract = {The paper investigates a number of asymmetries in the behavior of subjects in Germanic, Celtic/Arabic, Romance, and Greek. The languages under investigation divide into two main groups with respect to a cluster of properties, including the availability of pro-drop with referential subjects, the possibility of VSO/VOS orders, the A/A′ status of subjects in SVO orders, the presence/absence of Definiteness Restriction (DR)-effects in unaccusative constructions, the existence of verb-raising independently of V-2, and others. We argue that the key factor in this split is a parametrization in the way the Extended Projection Principle (EPP) is checked: move/merge XP vs. move/merge \$\{{\textbackslash}rm X\}{\textasciicircum}\{0\}\$. The first option is taken in Germanic, the second in Celtic, Greek, and Romance. According to our proposal, the EPP relates to checking of a nominal feature of AGR (cf. Chomsky 1995), and move/merge \$\{{\textbackslash}rm X\}{\textasciicircum}\{0\}\$ languages satisfy the EPP via V-raising, as their verbal agreement morphology includes the requisite nominal feature (cf. Taraldsen 1978). Moreover, we demonstrate that the further differences that exist between Celtic/Arabic on the one hand and Romance/Greek on the other are related to the parametric availability of Spec, TP for subjects (cf. Jonas and Bobaljik 1993, Bobaljik and Jonas 1996). In Celtic and Arabic, Spec, TP for subjects is licensed, resulting in VSO orders with VP external subjects. In Greek and Romance, Spec, TP is not licensed, resulting in 'subject inverted' orders with VP internal subjects. In other words, we show that within the class of move/merge \$\{{\textbackslash}rm X\}{\textasciicircum}\{0\}\$ languages, a further partition emerges which is due to the same parameter dividing Germanic languages into two major classes. We demonstrate that combining the proposed EPP/AGR parameter with the Spec, TP parameter gives four language-types with distinct properties.},

I begin by decomposing tenses syntactically into a temporal ordering predicate (the true tense, on this approach) and two time-denoting arguments corresponding to covert a reference time (RT) argument and an eventuality time (ET) argument containing the verb phrase. Control theory accounts for the denotation of the RT argument, deriving the distinction between main clause and subordinate clause tenses. The theory of covert movement is used to account for the independent/indexical interpretation of relative clause tenses, and for the correlation between independent tense interpretation and a de re construal of the relative clause. A theory of “past polarity”, based on traditional negative polarity theory, accounts both for the simultaneous “sequence of tense” construal of past tenses in subordinate clauses embedded within past tense contexts, and for the obligatory indexical/independent interpretation of present tense in a relative clause embedded within a past tense context. Combined with the copy theory of movement, the polarity theory also provides an account of the semantics of double access sentences, treating them as involving a special kind of reconstruction effect.},

In Balkan clauses, the phrase headed by the complementizer takes a phrase headed by an invariant modal particle as complement. The Tense/Agreement complex, the auxiliaries, and the main verb follow MP. In addition, Balkan languages share interesting varieties of \$\{{\textbackslash}rm X\}{\textasciicircum}\{0\}{\textbackslash}text\{-movement\}\$ for non-finite verbs, with theoretical consequences for principles of UG. In Bulgarian and Rumanian, (Long) Head-movement raises \$\{{\textbackslash}rm V\}{\textasciicircum}\{0\}\$ to C0 across the finite \$\{{\textbackslash}rm Aux\}{\textasciicircum}\{0\}\$, as in Pročel sǔm knigata 'I have read the book'; such structures comply with the Empty Category Principle via Relativized Minimality, and escape the Head Movement Constraint. In Albanian, Greek, and Rumanian, Head-movement places the imperative \$\{{\textbackslash}rm V\}{\textasciicircum}\{0\}\$ in C0, as in Ghrápse to 'Write it!'. Albanian imperatives show Long Head Movement and comply with the ECP like other LHM patterns in cases where the V-stem precedes the clitic and the affix in that order: Tregoj-i-ni 'Tell him!'.

For simplex sentences without time adverb or aspectual marker, I show that temporal reference is correlated with aktionsart or grammatical viewpoint. For sentences with an aspectual marker, I discuss the temporal semantics of le and guo in detail, showing how their tense/aspectual meanings contribute to temporal reference. I propose to analyze le as an event realization operator and guo as an anteriority operator. For subordinate clauses, I show that temporal reference of complement clauses of verbs is basically determined by verbal semantics of individual verbs, which may impose some temporal restriction on the temporal location of the embedded event. As for relative clauses and temporal adverbial clauses, many different factors such as lexical verbal semantics, referential properties of determiners, lifetime effect of noun phrases, semantic or pragmatics constraints on temporal connectives, inference rules and world knowledge, etc., all interact to help determine temporal reference. Many data discussed in this paper indicate that there is no evidence of (covert) tenses in Chinese. Therefore, challenging work remains for those who have claimed that Tense Phrase is projected in Chinese phrase structures.},

Under the standard assumption that the subject remains relatively low in these languages compared to Germanic languages, this category fails to be a diagnostic, since both verb movement operations cross the subject. The analysis presented here starts from the theory of verb movement developed in Koeneman (2000), which argues that the verb does not move to prefabricated functional head positions but moves in order to project one or more of its functional features (tense and agreement). It is shown how this theory offers a better understanding of verb movement (parameters) than mainstream approaches. After developing a concrete proposal for verb movement variation in Germanic, the paper tries to extend this analysis to the Celtic languages, so that a uniform analysis of verb movement (variation) ensues. The main conclusion is that it is very unlikely that Celtic languages have a verb movement operation involving an agreement projection. They are better analyzed as having a verb movement operation that projects tense features. The result is that the nature of verb movement in Germanic and Celtic is basically the same.},

	abstract = {Results of measurements of vocalized syllable-end consonants are presented. Samples of the speech of eight speakers (three from Aukštaitija (northeast Lithuania) and five from Dzūkija (southern Lithuania)) and six singers (three from each of the regions) were analyzed. The methods of acoustical analysis (Praat-aided) and statistical analysis were applied. The analyzed parameters include time values of the consonants, their SPLs, F1 and F2 of their vocalized parts, and their pitch excursions from the preceding vowels. The collation of the results of consonant measurements led to the following inference: a distinct enunciation in the spoken dialect correlates with the vocalization of consonants in the singing: the difference in the values in speech transforms into the difference in the values of musical parameters, in exaggerated form. Dzūkai show higher values of the vocalization, in comparison with Aukštaičiai. Hence, some traits of the singing dialect are neither 'purely musical' nor 'purely vocal', but rather speech-dependent. The results raise some practical implications concerning the ethnomusicological studies and practical singing in the contemporary folk groups. (English)},

The present study investigates how the harmonic context influences the processing of phonemes in vocal music. Eight-chord sequences were presented to participants. The four notes of each chord were played with synthetic phonemes and participants were required to quickly decide whether the last chord (the target) was sung on a syllable containing the phoneme /i/ or /u/. The musical relationship of the target chord to the previous context was manipulated so that the target chord acted as a referential tonic chord or as a congruent but less structurally important subdominant chord. Phoneme monitoring was faster for the tonic chord than for the subdominant chord. This finding has several implications for music cognition and speech perception. It also suggests that musical and phonemic processing interact at some stage of processing.},

The considerable voice timbre differences between musical theater (MT) and western operatic singers are analyzed with respect to voice source and formant frequencies in five representatives of each singer group. Audio, subglottal pressure (Psub), and electroglottograph (EGG) signals were recorded while the subjects sang a sequence of [pae:] syllables starting at maximal vocal loudness and then gradually decreasing vocal loudness. The task was performed at each of two fundamental frequencies (F0), approximately one octave apart. Ten equally spaced Psub values were then selected for each F0. The subsequent vowels were analyzed in terms of flow glottograms derived by inverse filtering the audio signal, which also yielded formant frequency data. Period time (T0), peak-to-peak pulse amplitude (Up-t-p), and maximum flow declination rate (MFDR) were measured from the flow glottograms while closed quotient Qclosed (Tcl/T0) was determined in combination with the differentiated EGG signal. Also the relationship between the first and the second harmonic in the spectrum (H1–H2), the amplitude quotient (AQ), that is, the ratio between Up-t-p and MFDR, and normalized AQ, that is, AQ normalized with respect to period time was calculated as well as the sound pressure level. The results showed that both the MT and the opera singers varied their Psub systematically, approximately doubling Psub for a doubling of F0. For a given value of Psub, the MT singers produced higher values of MFDR, Up-t-p, and Qclosed, and lower values of H1–H2, indicating a weaker fundamental. Further, the MT singers showed higher formant frequencies and did not show the opera singers' characteristic clustering of F3, F4, and F5.},

Vocal fold vibrations were observed with high-speed photography, using a computerized recording system. The spectral characteristics of the sound signal were analyzed. Kymographic image data were compared to the sound signal and flow inverse filtering data from the same singer were obtained on a separate occasion. It was found that the vocal folds vibrated at the same frequency throughout both modes of singing. During throat singing the ventricular folds vibrated with complete but short closures at half the frequency of the true vocal folds, covering every second vocal fold closure. Kymographic data confirmed the findings. The spectrum contained added subharmonics compared to modal voice. In the inverse filtered signal the amplitude of every second airflow pulse was considerably lowered. The ventricular folds appeared to modulate the sound by reducing the glottal flow of every other vocal fold vibratory cycle.},

The lyric voice is found to make a gradual diminuendo while maintaining nearly constant posture of the vocal tract together with a phase of complete closure in the glottal cycle. The robust voice, by contrast, passes abruptly from a production of high subglottal pressure and a high closed quotient to one of low pressure and incomplete closure, and the transition is marked by a sudden opening of the previously constricted laryngeal collar.

This study examined trained singers' and untrained singers' (nonsingers') sensitivity to subtle manipulations in auditory feedback and the subsequent effect on the mapping between F0 feedback and vocal control.

Results showed that singers and nonsingers compensated to a similar degree when presented with frequency-altered feedback (FAF); however, singers' F0 values were consistently closer to the intended pitch target. Moreover, singers initiated their compensatory responses when auditory feedback was shifted up or down 6 cents or more, compared to nonsingers who began compensating when feedback was shifted up 26 cents and down 22 cents. Additionally, examination of the first 50 ms of vocalization indicated that participants commenced subsequent vocal utterances, during FAF, near the F0 value on previous shift trials. Interestingly, nonsingers commenced F0 productions below the pitch target and increased their F0 until they matched the note. Thus, singers and nonsingers rely on an internal model to regulate voice F0, but singers' models appear to be more sensitive in response to subtle discrepancies in auditory feedback.},

It is hypothesized that operatic singing uses vowels that are modified toward an inverted megaphone mouth shape for transitioning into the high-pitch range. This allows all the harmonics except the fundamental to be “lifted” over the first formant. Belting, on the other hand, uses vowels that are consistently modified toward the megaphone (trumpet-like) mouth shape. Both the fundamental and the second harmonic are then kept below the first formant. The vocal tract shapes provide collective reinforcement to multiple harmonics in the form of inertive supraglottal reactance and compliant subglottal reactance.

After factoring out each singer’s average, the 36 pitch-corrected LTAS contours were reduced to a two-dimensional representation in two ways: (1) a principal-component analysis and (2) a graphical plot of spectral slope versus speaker’s formant strength. Both ways clearly separate the three styles. The spectrum of the klapa style turns out to be similar to that of speech. The ojkanje style is extremely loud and shows two spectral peaks: a sharp one tuned at twice the fundamental frequency and appropriate for long-distance communication on mountain slopes, and a broad one around 3.5 kHz, reminiscent of a speaker’s formant. The tarankanje style has a very flat spectrum implemented by vocal pressedness and nasality, which is appropriate for blending into or imitating the timbral characteristics of the sopile folk instrument.},

This investigation aims at describing voice function of four nonclassical styles of singing, Rock, Pop, Soul, and Swedish Dance Band. A male singer, professionally experienced in performing in these genres, sang representative tunes, both with their original lyrics and on the syllable /pae/. In addition, he sang tones in a triad pattern ranging from the pitch Bb2 to the pitch C4 on the syllable /pae/ in pressed and neutral phonation. An expert panel was successful in classifying the samples, thus suggesting that the samples were representative of the various styles. Subglottal pressure was estimated from oral pressure during the occlusion for the consonant [p]. Flow glottograms were obtained from inverse filtering. The four lowest formant frequencies differed between the styles. The mean of the subglottal pressure and the mean of the normalized amplitude quotient (NAQ), that is, the ratio between the flow pulse amplitude and the product of period and maximum flow declination rate, were plotted against the mean of fundamental frequency. In these graphs, Rock and Swedish Dance Band assumed opposite extreme positions with respect to subglottal pressure and mean phonation frequency, whereas the mean NAQ values differed less between the styles.},

In their concern with disadvantaged members of society and their focus on functional differences in language use, the authors draw on early research by Robinson concerning language and social behavior for working- and middle-class speakers. First, they present evidence concerning the importance of sustained heritage language (Inuttitut) development in second-language acquisition and address the implications of this finding in terms of additive versus subtractive bilingualism in the North. Second, they contrast the language proficiencies of children in the two dominant languages, English and French, exploring variations in status and their concomitant effects on language acquisition. Finally, they compare the conversational versus academic language proficiencies of Inuit children in the context of minority versus dominant language education and discuss implications for the debate on language deficits versus differences for disadvantaged children.},

It documents a grassroots Inuit literacy initiative in Ottawa, Canada and considers literacy practices among Inuit at a local Inuit educational centre, where maintaining connections between urban Inuit and their homeland linguistic and cultural practices is a central objective. Using data from a participatory, activity-oriented, ethnographic project at an Inuit family literacy centre, we argue that state-driven language policies have opened up spaces for Indigenous-defined language and literacy learning activities that can shape and be shaped by family language policies. This has permitted some urban groups in Canada to define their own literacy needs in order to develop effective family language policies. Drawing on two Inuit-centred literacy activities, we demonstrate how literacy practices are embedded in intergenerational sharing of Inuit experience, cultural memory, and stories and how these are associated spatially, culturally, and materially with objects and representations. We thus show how Inuit-centred literacy practices can be a driving force for family language policy, linking people to an urban Inuit educational community centre and to their urban and Arctic Inuit families and homelands.},

	abstract = {Background: Pharmaceutical communication is an essential component of pharmaceutical health care, optimally ensuring patients understand the proper administration and side effects of their medications. Communication can often be complicated by language and culture, but with pharmaceuticals, misunderstandings can prove particularly harmful. In Nunavut, to ensure the preservation and revitalization of Inuit languages, the Inuit Language Protection Act and Official Languages Act were passed requiring that all public and private sector essential services offer verbal and written communication in Inuit languages (Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun) by 2012.; Methods: While the legislation mandates compliance, policy implementation for pharmaceutical services is problematic. Not a single pharmacist in Nunavut is fluent in either of the Inuit languages. Pharmacists have indicated challenges in formally translating written documentation into Inuit languages based on concerns for patient safety. These challenges of negotiating the joint requirements of language legislation and patient safety have resulted in pharmacies using verbal on-site translation as a tenuous solution regardless of its many limitations.; Results: The complex issues of pharmaceutical health care and communication among the Inuit of Nunavut are best examined through multimethod research to encompass a wide range of perspectives. This methodology combines the richness of ethnographic data, the targeted depth of interviews with key informants and the breadth of cross-Canada policy and financial analyses.; Conclusions: The analysis of this information would provide valuable insights into the current relationships between health care providers, pharmacists and Inuit patients and suggest future directions for policy that will improve the efficacy of pharmaceuticals and health care spending for the Inuit in Canada.;},

A grammaticality judgment study suggests that RBs possess sensitivity to morphosyntactic violations, though to a lesser degree than fluent bilinguals. Low-proficiency RBs are sensitive only to the most basic grammatical properties. Case omission is most difficult to detect, but morphemes bearing incorrect features (case oversuppliance, number agreement mismatch) or ordered incorrectly (tense and agreement, tense and negation) are easier, and performance on incorrect ordering of morphemes is near target with the core agreement morpheme for all RBs. While receptive bilinguals show patterns of grammatical deficits, they also demonstrate clear knowledge of the basic properties of word structure in Inuttitut. This has implications both for the psycholinguistics of bilingualism and for language revitalization efforts.},

This process presented numerous challenges, from choosing citation forms in a polysynthetic language to dealing with a lack of word frequency data. Twenty heritage receptive bilinguals (RBs) with very limited production skills in Inuttitut (their first language) and a comparison group of eight fluent bilinguals (FBs) participated in our study. Since the RBs lacked production skills in Inuttitut, the lexical test required participants to translate a carefully compiled list of Inuttitut nouns and verbs into English. The results revealed that RBs had good comprehension of basic vocabulary (85\% accuracy), but differed significantly from FBs, mostly because the RBs had a number of partially accurate translations. The three lowest scoring RBs had the highest number of such translations as well as inaccurate translations based on phonological associations, as is common in emergent lexicons. This lexical test correlates with grammatical proficiency measures, pointing to its potential value as a quick placement and diagnostic test in revitalization programs for Inuttitut as well as other languages in a language loss situation.},

Half lived in communities with relatively high exposure to the majority language (English), while the other half lived in communities with low exposure. One third of each group were in Grade 3 (first year of school exposure to majority language), one third in Grade 8/9 (sixth year of school exposure) and one third were adults. Each participant narrated a 24-page wordless picture book (Frog Story) in Inuktitut. Narrations were analysed for story length, lexical diversity, grammatical complexity and narrative structure – all measures that are expected to increase or show improvement with increased language ability. Results are inconclusive; some suggest that higher exposure to English leads to stagnation in Inuktitut, while others do not.

Based on observation and interviews with Inuit, anglophone, and francophone respondents, it seeks to understand how language behavior may be understood as an expression of Inuit identity. The description outlines a few salient points of the present-day linguistic situation in the Baffin Region: the role played by English as a lingua franca (common language); an apparent correlation between schooling and a decreasing use of Inuktitut in daily life (high school students and educated adults speak much less Inuktitut than less educated individuals); and, at the same time, the strength of the aboriginal language, which is still widely spoken and routinely transmitted to the new Inuit generations. Opinions of Inuit informants on the usefulness and importance of each language reveal the existence of a dichotomy of sorts. English is deemed more useful than Inuktitut, because it paves the way to better employment and opens a window on the wider world, but Inuktitut is generally perceived as essential in defining Inuit identity. Many think that with the advent of Nunavut, Inuktitut will become a prerequisite for holding a job, thus increasing its practical usefulness.},

In this paper I review existing literature on bilingual Inuit children to explore the prospects for the survival of Inuktitut given the increase in the use of English in these regions. Studies on code mixing and subject realization among simultaneous bilingual children ages 2–4 years show a strong foundation in Inuktitut, regardless of extensive exposure to English in the home. However, three studies of older Inuit children exposed to English through school reveal some stagnation in children's Inuktitut and increasing use of English with age, even in nonschool contexts. I conclude that current choices about language use at the personal, school, and societal levels will determine whether Inuit are able to reach and maintain stable bilingualism, or whether Inuktitut will decline significantly in favor of majority languages.},

All dialects that have completely lost this contrast also lack palatalization. Why are there no /i, a, u/ dialects in which all instances of surface [i] trigger palatalization? We propose that this typological gap can be explained using a contrastivist analysis whereby only contrastive features can be phonologically active, palatalization is triggered by [coronal], and contrastive features are assigned in an order placing [low] and [labial] ahead of [coronal]. In a three-vowel inventory only [low] and [labial] are contrastive, while in the four-vowel inventory [coronal] must also be contrastive to distinguish strong and weak i. It follows from these assumptions that [i] can trigger palatalization only if it is in contrast with a fourth vowel. (English)},

On the one hand, we observed a clustering effect around shared political views among supporters of the same party in the Twitter communication network, suggesting that there are pockets of political polarization on Twitter. At the same time, there was evidence of cross-ideological connections and exchanges, which may facilitate open, cross-party, and cross-ideological discourse, and ignite wider debate and learning as they are observed by nonaffiliated voters and the media at large. However, what appeared to be far less likely was any increased willingness or tendency for committed partisans to shift their allegiances as a result of their Twitter engagements, and we postulate that Twitter usage at present is likely to further embed partisan loyalties during electoral periods rather than loosen them; a dynamic that would seemingly contribute to political polarization.},

Such directed links determine the flow of information and hence indicate a user's influence on others — a concept that is crucial in sociology and viral marketing. In this paper, using a large amount of data collected from Twitter, we present an in-depth comparison of three measures of influence: indegree, retweets, and mentions. Based on these measures, we investigate the dynamics of user influence across topics and time. We make several interesting observations. First, popular users who have high indegree are not necessarily influential in terms of spawning retweets or mentions. Second, most influential users can hold significant influence over a variety of topics. Third, influence is not gained spontaneously or accidentally, but through concerted effort such as limiting tweets to a single topic. We believe that these findings provide new insights for viral marketing and suggest that topological measures such as indegree alone reveals very little about the influence of a user.},

The process leading to fission is viewed as an unequal flow of sentiments and information across the ties in a social network. This flow is unequal because it is uniquely constrained by the contextual range and sensitivity of each relationship in the network. The subsequent differential sharing of sentiments leads to the formation of subgroups with more internal stability than the group as a whole, and results in fission. The Ford-Fulkerson labeling algorithm allows an accurate prediction of membership in the subgroups and of the locus of the fission to be made from measurements of the potential for information flow across each edge in the network. Methods for measurement of potential information flow are discussed, and it is shown that all appropriate techniques will generate the same predictions.},

This convergence property may be used as the basis of an algorithm (CONCOR) for hierarchical clustering. The CONCOR procedure is applied to several illustrative sets of social network data and is found to give results that are highly compatible with analyses and interpretations of the same data using the blockmodel approach of White ( White, Boorman \& Breiger, 1976 ). The results using CONCOR are then compared with results obtained using alternative methods of clustering and scaling (MDSCAL, INDSCAL, HICLUS, ADCLUS) on the same data sets.},

However, the existing centrality measures are not adequate in network percolation scenarios (such as during infection transmission in a social network of individuals, spreading of computer viruses on computer networks, or transmission of disease over a network of towns) because they do not account for the changing percolation states of individual nodes. We propose a new measure, percolation centrality, that quantifies relative impact of nodes based on their topological connectivity, as well as their percolation states. The measure can be extended to include random walk based definitions, and its computational complexity is shown to be of the same order as that of betweenness centrality. We demonstrate the usage of percolation centrality by applying it to a canonical network as well as simulated and real world scale-free and random networks.},

Boston starting chains reach the target person with fewer intermediaries than those starting in Nebraska; subpopulations in the Nebraska group do not differ among themselves.

Under-and oversocialized accounts are paradoxically similar in their neglect of ongoing structures of social relations, and a sophisticated account of economic action must consider its embeddedness in such structures.

	abstract = {Centrality measures, or at least popular interpretations of these measures, make implicit assumptions about the manner in which traffic flows through a network. For example, some measures count only geodesic paths, apparently assuming that whatever flows through the network only moves along the shortest possible paths. This paper lays out a typology of network flows based on two dimensions of variation, namely the kinds of trajectories that traffic may follow (geodesics, paths, trails, or walks) and the method of spread (broadcast, serial replication, or transfer). Measures of centrality are then matched to the kinds of flows that they are appropriate for. Simulations are used to examine the relationship between type of flow and the differential importance of nodes with respect to key measurements such as speed of reception of traffic and frequency of receiving traffic. It is shown that the off-the-shelf formulas for centrality measures are fully applicable only for the specific flow processes they are designed for, and that when they are applied to other flow processes they get the “wrong” answer. It is noted that the most commonly used centrality measures are not appropriate for most of the flows we are routinely interested in. A key claim made in this paper is that centrality measures can be regarded as generating expected values for certain kinds of node outcomes (such as speed and frequency of reception) given implicit models of how traffic flows, and that this provides a new and useful way of thinking about centrality.},

In this paper we develop in detail the theory of random graphs with arbitrary degree distributions. In addition to simple undirected, unipartite graphs, we examine the properties of directed and bipartite graphs. Among other results, we derive exact expressions for the position of the phase transition at which a giant component first forms, the mean component size, the size of the giant component if there is one, the mean number of vertices a certain distance away from a randomly chosen vertex, and the average vertex-vertex distance within a graph. We apply our theory to some real-world graphs, including the world-wide web and collaboration graphs of scientists and Fortune 1000 company directors. We demonstrate that in some cases random graphs with appropriate distributions of vertex degree predict with surprising accuracy the behavior of the real world, while in others there is a measurable discrepancy between theory and reality, perhaps indicating the presence of additional social structure in the network that is not captured by the random graph.},

A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.},

This type of variation is well-documented. However, this is not the case for the syntactic component, which could lead one to believe that there are very few syntactic differences between NAF \& SF. This article deals with some differences between NAF \& SF in the prepositional \& complementizer systems. More precisely, we argue that the fact that stranded prepositions appear more freely in NAF than in SF is related to facts regarding variation in the complementizer system. 24 References.

The present study investigated whether syntactic information is shared by testing if syntactic priming occurs between languages. Spanish-English bilingual participants described cards to each other in a dialogue game. We found that a participant who had just heard a sentence in Spanish tended to use the same type of sentence when describing the next card in English. In particular, English passives were considerably more common following a Spanish passive than otherwise. We use the results to extend current models of the representation of grammatical information to bilinguals.},

I will then turn to the issue of whether the properties of the functional sequence (ordering, cooccurrence restrictions) are amenable to 'further explanations' in terms of more basic principles constraining linguistic computations. I will argue that the search for deeper explanations is an integral part of the cartographic endeavour: it presupposes the establishment of reliable maps, and nourishes the pursuit of further cartographic questions. I will conclude by illustrating the issue of further explanation by comparing certain properties of topicalization in English and Italian, in particular the fact that DP topics are fundamentally unique in English, while they can be freely reiterated in Italian. This pattern can be plausibly traced back to intervention locality, once certain independent properties distinguishing Italian and English topicalization are taken into account.},

Style therefore refers to the wide range of strategic actions and performances that speakers engage in, to construct themselves and their social lives. Coupland draws on and integrates a wide variety of contemporary sociolinguistic research as well as his own extensive research in this field. The emphasis is on how social meanings are made locally, in specific relationships, genres, groups and cultures, and on studying language variation as part of the analysis of spoken discourse.},

Our study is based on the analysis of an extensive database comprising a wide range of seventeenth-, eighteenth-, nineteenth-, and early twentieth-century sources providing information on the typical features of nonstandard spoken European and Quebec French. It reveals that ne deletion became widespread in nonstandard spoken French only in the nineteenth century and leads us to hypothesize that the affixal status of subject clitic pronouns contributed to the rise of ne deletion},

	abstract = {Traditionally speaking, the study of variation in English has generally pursued a path separate from and not always parallel to that of "mainstream" linguistics, especially when it came to matters of theoretical interest. Shortly after the transformational-generative revolution in 1957, however, it became clear that this could no longer be the case if the theory-building enterprise was to succeed, for the T-G myth of a completely homogeneous speech community placed serious obstacles in the way of making significant general statements about language. Linguistic heterogeneity, many linguists concluded, insofar as it was patterned, had to be considered a part of human linguistic competence and accounted for in the theory of language.
In 1968, David DeCamp suggested that that variation had a primarily qualitative basis. In many cases, he claimed, it was possible to make general implicational statements of the form: "If a speaker uses linguistic feature A, he also uses feature B, and if B, then C, and so forth." Overall patterns such as this would, if verified, clarify many phenomena which were customarily dismissed as intractable or chaotic and make possible a very elegant theoretical account of linguistic heterogeneity, that is, dialects, stylistic varieties, individual language differences, etc.
Though he did not know it at the time of his proposal, DeCamp had hit on a form of data analysis known as scalogram analysis, which had actually been developed during World War II and considerably refined since then by measurement theorists and social and behavioral scientists. It took several years for linguists to learn of the coincidence, and when they did, they generally overlooked the readily available body of enlightening and cautionary literature that these non-linguists had produced.
My thesis attempts to correct this oversight by examining these neglected writings and by adapting and coordinating a set of rigorous statistical and methodological standards for judging the operational adequacy of any given implicational or scalogram analysis. That is, the central question which this dissertation tries to answer is whether the data arrays advanced by "qualitative" linguists actually form "scales" in the operationally accepted Guttman sense; this is equivalent to testing whether the claimed implicational relations are stable and significant enough to necessitate a formal theoretical account. Also, since the technique of scalogram analysis is basically a form of measurement, the findings derived from the application of rigorous scale criteria provide, in most cases, a reliable test of the empirical foundations of the theoretical inferences that a given qualitative analysis may motivate. In critiques of ten representative scalar studies I found serious difficulties with claims of significant implicational patterning and called into question the theoretical assertions to which they correspond. These assertions ranged from rather localized issues such as postulated underlying syntactic structures to broader considerations of which overall model of linguistic variation to prefer on the basis of observational and descriptive adequacy.},

This paper focuses on insights into the concomitant processes taking place in language users' minds. It takes up ideas on concept-formation and hypostatization put forward in the philosophy of language, word-formation and lexical semantics and relates them to recent evidence on the processing and storage of nonce-formations and recently coined complex words collected by psycholinguists and neurolinguists. The role of frequency of exposure and semantic transparency in the increasing entrenchment of concepts in language users' memories is discussed. Effects of hypostatization – the subjective impression that the existence of a word suggests the existence of a class of things denoted by the word – are shown to be very strong even in the early phases of the establishment of new words, and pragmatic exploitations of these effects are explored.},

	abstract = {The study of style within the variationist tradition in sociolinguistics has received little attention in general terms. Some of the main introductory textbooks dealing with this discipline hardly mention style as a variable, and, when they do, they usually understand style as a reflection of the speaker’s attention to his/her own speech. Contrary to this tradition, two main approaches have been proposed. First, in the Audience Design model [Bell, A., 1984. Language style as audience design. Language in Society 13, 145–204] stylistic variation is seen as the result of an adaptation to the features of a present or absent audience. Second, in the so-called Speaker Design model, stylistic variation is seen as a process of identity building. In our study, we analyse the speech of a radio presenter in a local station in Murcia and compare it to the audience’s linguistic behaviour as shown in the phone calls received during the programme. We also analyse the data obtained in an interview with the radio presenter. Our results, which show a radical divergence between the presenter’s speech and that of his audience, are contrasted with both Audience Design and Speaker Design theoretical tenets, using the explicit knowledge of the presenter’s attitudes and opinions to contrast theory and fact. We conclude that neither model offers a completely satisfactory explanation of the patterns found. Finally, we reflect on the need to consider not only performance, but also the script (in the form of a professional voice used following a particular linguistic policy based on sociolinguistic norms and attitudes to language) that condition the individual linguistic behaviour, thus suggesting the need to consider community-specific factors in the explanation of stylistic variation.},

	abstract = {This thesis investigates lexical variation between three dialects of French in various stages of language death. Those dialects are Pedagogical French, an international language, Cajun French, an obsolescing language, and Mississippi Gulf Coast French, an extinct language. In order to determine the degree of variation, thirty-two lexical items or phrases that display variance with Pedagogical French are selected from Mississippi Gulf Coast French. They are then compared with counterparts in Pedagogical French and Cajun French to determine the amount of variance between dialects.
I hypothesized that there is a larger degree of variation between the Gulf Coast dialects and Pedagogical French than between the Gulf Coast dialects themselves. This proved not to be the case. While Mississippi Gulf Coast French does display more similarities with Cajun French than Pedagogical French based on the biased sample, Cajun French demonstrates more similarities with Pedagogical French than with Mississippi Gulf Coast French. This, coupled with the large number of English loan words that has made their way into the Mississippi Gulf Coast French lexicon, leads to the conclusion that Mississippi Gulf Coast French has undergone significant language change during its last years. Due to the declining number of speakers, and the fact that those final speakers were bilingual, English heavily influenced Mississippi Gulf Coast French in its final years of use. As this did not occur with Cajun French, it remained closer to Pedagogical French.},

	abstract = {This study documents variation in the French of Terrebonne and Lafourche Parishes, Louisiana, seeking possible correspondence between language variation and ethnicity or geographic origin of the speaker. In doing so the study seeks to document the French of a long-neglected Francophone community, the American Indians of South Louisiana. Both general and scholarly presentations of francophone Louisiana have tended to stress the Acadian ancestry of Louisiana French, thereby misrepresenting the complexity of Louisiana's linguistic and ethnic makeup. Native American francophones have been particularly neglected by researchers, under the assumption, untested, that they have fully assimilated to their white (Cajun) neighbours, including the adoption a French identical to theirs in the 19th century as a result of extensive contact and intermarriage.
The study is based on extensive ethnolinguistic fieldwork conducted over a nearly three-year period from January of 2006 until the fall of 2008. Data were collected in two parts. The first was an extensive sociolinguistic interview, comprising a translation exercise and a long sociolinguistic questionnaire that collected a sample of casual speech in addition to demographic information. The second was a perception exercise in which informants were asked to listen to sound clips and guess the ethnic and regional affiliation of the speaker. Both these elements were buttressed by extensive participant observation.
The results reveal a complex interplay between ethnic and geographic variation in the region. While no features emerged that were unique to Louisiana (whether to Indians or Cajuns), a general pattern exists that distinguishes Indians from Cajuns and links the Indian communities to each other. Moreover, there is additional variation within both the Indian and Cajun communities, with Indians attesting more internal variation than Cajuns and each Indian community distinguishing itself in some way—if not several ways—from the others. The town of Dulac/Grand Caillou further emerged as the source of many of the Indian patterns of speech. Finally, the perception test revealed a tendency within the area to minimize the importance of recognized variation, and moreover revealed a possible lowering of long-held barriers between ethnic groups in the region.},

	abstract = {This dissertation is a quantitative treatment of the nature of variation and change in linguistic structures in Cajun French, a stigmatized variety spoken in southwest Louisiana. A main tenet of variation theory holds that variation is an inherent and rule-governed property of human languages constrained by both linguistic and social conditioning environments. Studies in this area attempt to discover the systematicity of variability within the social context of the language. Recent studies in varieties of French have illustrated that the pronoun systems are highly unstable, thus well-suited to this sort of linguistic inquiry. Thibault 1986 studies that the grammaticalization of third person pronouns and the growing frequency of the traditionally inanimate pronoun ca 'that' referring a definite, animate pronoun. The research in this study extends the investigation of the grammaticalization of personal pronouns, using the thus far unexplored source of Cajun French. The fluid state of the pronominal system in Cajun is often alluded to in the literature, however, the subject has not yet been pursued for analysis. This study, therefore, assumes the task of analyzing the variability in third person pronouns, and in particular, the linguistic and social factors conditioning the behavior of c ca.
The social context is particularly significant in this research for several distinctive and influential characteristics of the language. First, Cajun is a minority language under the constant pressure of a majority language, English. Linguistic change and variation is thus seen in light of such forces which could over a period of time alter syntactic structures. Second, the language is oral which renders it highly susceptible to variation from a historical written norm. Third, the Cajun culture is experiencing a revival movement instilling a sense of pride among the speakers and lending prestige to the variety. While for some time Cajun was rapidly losing native speakers, the revival may halt this trend.
The results indicate that the "weakening trend" in the Cajun pronoun system suggested in the literature can, in fact, be supported by systematic statistical analysis. Furthermore, the analysis points to innovations in pronominal usage as well as evidence suggesting the linguistic pressure of English.},

	abstract = {Languages from differing language families spoken in enclave communities in various parts of the world have been found to exhibit similarities in what is viewed as a 'simplification' of their structures vis-a-vis their corresponding standard dialects (Maher 1985). One of the aspects considered to contribute to a more 'simplified' structure is the replacement of synthetic structures by analytic ones. Analyticity and syntheticity have played a role in language typology, and the cycle is of particular interest in the Romance languages, where Latin is considered the synthetic language par excellence, while French is generally regarded as being highly analytic in comparison. Schwegler (1990) redefines analytic and synthetic, predicating these notions on the spoken, as opposed to the written, language.
This dissertation analyzes the verb group, consisting of the subject and object clitics and the verb, of Cajun French, an enclave language spoken in Louisiana, that has been isolated from the influence of Standard French for some 200 years. The analysis is based on Schwegler's (1990) new definitions of analyticity and syntheticity, which are especially appropriate for this dialect because it has no written form. The data reveal that Cajun French shares many common features with Informal Spoken French, and the net result is that Cajun French is far more synthetic than an analysis based on the written standard would yield.},

	abstract = {In the course of the twentieth century, English has come to replace French—specifically, the variety known as Cajun French or Louisiana Regional French—as the primary language of communication in South Louisiana. In this language shift process, Cajun French has continued its steady decline in spite of French educational programs—including French immersion—established since the creation of the Council for the Development of French in Louisiana (CODOFIL) in 1968 as well as a Cajun cultural revival. Today's high school students—who are generally monolingual in English but may have contact with Cajun French in family or community contexts and contact with International (i.e., Standard) French in educational settings—will be influential in determining the fate of Cajun French in Louisiana. This study presents survey data from 586 high school students in 13 schools in five parishes (i.e., counties) in Acadiana, Louisiana's French Triangle, to examine the extent of young people's contact with French as well as their attitudes toward Cajun French and International French. The quantitative analysis focuses on responses to opinion items on the questionnaire, and qualitative data from short-answer questions and interviews with 36 participants is also considered.
Access to French education varies: Some parishes offer French instruction, or even French immersion, from elementary through high school, but French is limited to high school in others. Positive attitudes toward Cajun French are generally in evidence, but widespread French ability has not been achieved through educational programs. Results indicate that students who self-identify as Cajun express interest in learning Cajun French, and students with the greatest amount of French education display a willingness to use French (e.g., in the workplace). Thus, more extensive French education for students who self-identify as Cajun may be the best hope for the continued existence of Cajun French in South Louisiana.},

	abstract = {Efforts to preserve the spoken French of Louisiana have raised the question of which variety of French should be taught or which variants among all varieties could serve as acceptable components of a pedagogical norm. Proposals have ranged from imposing a standard French norm to teaching a selected dialect of Cajun French. The present study surveys usage patterns and language attitudes of Cajun French speakers located in fourteen parishes (counties) of southern Louisiana. Twenty-seven informants are interviewed in a pilot study; forty-nine English/Cajun French bilinguals, representing three socio-economic categories, are the focus of the main study. Five morphological variables are examined specifically: (1) The second-person formal--vous parlez vs. vous parle (you speak); (2) The future tense--elle parlera vs. elle va parler (she will speak); (3) The auxiliary etre (to be)--il est venu vs. il a venu (he came); (4) The third-person plural--ils jouent vs. ils jouont vs. ca joue (they play); (5) The interrogative"what"--qu'est-ce que vs. quoi vs. qui (what?)
The results reveal a general reduction of inflectional verb morphology, a tendency to replace synthetic with analytic forms, a reduction of allomorphs, and the geographical distribution of certain variants. Informant attitudes toward each of the variants, determined by informal observations and by a preference test, are compared with informant usage. The findings yield evidence that in this language contact, language death situation (where English dominates Cajun French) no general unified norm develops in the inferior language, a notion which in turn implies that any norm prescribed for that language must respect local usage patterns in order to be generally accepted. Recommendations for the nature of that norm are presented accordingly.},

Each paper explores one or more of these dimensions of stance from perspectives including interactional linguistics and conversation analysis, corpus linguistics, language description, discourse analysis, and sociocultural linguistics. Research languages include conversational American English, colloquial Indonesian, and Finnish.

	abstract = {Contemporary Louisiana French is a koine, the product of contact between several 18th- and 19th-century varieties of French. We will explore two variables with different outcomes in the context of dialect contact: qui vs. quoi ‘what’, and the J’AVONS pattern (e.g. j’avons, je parlons). The interrogatives qui and quoi are both still widely attested in Louisiana French, though in different locales. We explore Byers’ (1988) hypothesis that their distribution can be attributed to settlement patterns of Acadians (quoi) and 18th-century Creoles (qui). The J’AVONS pattern, though totally unattested today, is found in a dozen late 19th- and early 20th-century sources. Strikingly, though, most of these Louisiana attestations are not 1pl. but 1sg.We argue that this can be understood as a reanalysis of J’AVONS, precipitated by contact with non-J’AVONS dialects, prior to elimination of the form altogether, and contributing to the largely leveled verb paradigm one finds in Louisiana French today.},

In media studies the term “context collapse” describes the process by which online social networks bring together people from various social contexts, thereby creating a diverse networked audience. In online social networks that involve participants from different countries and language communities, language choice becomes a pertinent issue. This paper draws on empirical data from social networks among young multilingual people on Facebook to examine strategies of language choice and negotiation. Drawing on the sociolinguistic framework of audience design, the sociolinguistics of multilingualism and computer-mediated discourse analysis, the analysis examines language choice in initiating and responding contributions, metapragmatic negotiations of language style and the role of English as a resource among networked writers.},

Indexical order is central to analyzing how semiotic agents access macro-sociological plane categories and concepts as values in the indexable realm of the micro-contextual. Through such access their relational identities are presupposed and creatively (trans)formed in interaction. We work through several classic examples of indexicality well-known in the literature of sociolinguistics, the clarification of which can be enhanced by using the concept of indexical order, viz., ‘T/V’ deference-indexicality, speech levels, indexically significant variation in phonetics informed by a standard phonological register. We conclude with an analysis of identity-commoditizing indexical overlays such as the American English register here dubbed “oinoglossia,” ‘wine talk’.},

	abstract = {This paper argues for a focus on the social meaning of variation, based in a study of stylistic practice. It is common in the study of variation to interpret variables as reflections of speakers' membership in social categories. Others have argued more recently that variables are associated not with the categories themselves, but with stances and characteristics that constitute those categories. The paper reviews some variation studies that show that variables do not have static meanings, but rather general meanings that become more specific in the context of styles. Building on Michael Silverstein's notion of indexical order, I argue that the meanings of variables are not precise or fixed but rather constitute a field of potential meanings – an indexical field, or constellation of ideologically related meanings, any one of which can be activated in the situated use of the variable. The field is fluid, and each new activation has the potential to change the field by building on ideological connections. Thus variation constitutes an indexical system that embeds ideology in language and that is in turn part and parcel of the construction of ideology.},

In research on a specific variable, the historical present tense (HP), none of these methods proved neutral or adequate. Although the historical present tense is very widely used in conversational narratives, its occurrence within interviews is so infrequent as to be striking. An explanation was found in the way in which the interview has a specific known place as a speech event in the culture of those whose speech was being studied. The so-called spontaneous interview does not have such a place, and for that very reason is even less satisfactory a source of data. The notion of natural speech is taken as properly equivalent to that of appropriate speech; as not equivalent to unselfconscious speech; and as observable easily, and often best, by simple techniques of participation.},

using the word hello, and phonetic correlates of dialect can be discovered. In one
experiment, a series of telephone surveys was conducted; housing was requested from the

results demonstrate that landlords discriminate against prospective tenants on the basis
of the sound of their voice during telephone conversations. Another experiment was conducted
with untrained participants to confirm this ability; listeners identified the dialects
significantly better than chance. Phonetic analysis reveals that phonetic variables
potentially distinguish the dialects.},

We also propose a measure for the strength of the community structure found by our algorithms, which gives us an objective metric for choosing the number of communities into which a network should be divided. We demonstrate that our algorithms are highly effective at discovering community structure in both computer-generated and real-world network data, and show how they can be used to shed light on the sometimes dauntingly complex structure of networked systems.},

The valorization of non-linguistic behaviours as adding further explanatory power to sociolinguistic models is timely: it has often been implicit in linguistic study (through ethnography) but rarely been given recognition. However, the types of self-constituting communities of interest to sociolinguists are not the same as the communities of learning studied by Lave and Wenger (1991) and Wenger (1998). If this construct is to be useful to sociolinguists, then the mechanisms by which it models access, gate-keeping and its internal hierarchy need development. Using Eckert's (2000) Belten High data, and other work on adolescent talk, it is argued that gaining legitimate peripheral participation is a matter of sanction from within the hierarchy. Individuals do not have open access to communities based solely on their desire to be part of that community and to take part in its practices. While practices may define the community, the community determines who has access to that practice.},

This discussion shows, notably, how systemic and extra-systemic factors play a role in the emergence of these innovations. We also demonstrate that there are interesting differences in the extent to which these innovations are used across speaker groups and communities, and we argue that such differences suggest that there are thresholds of language contact associated with the emergence, or lack thereof, of particular transfer-induced innovations.},

In Part I, analysis of one Punjabi-derived phonetic trait, examined in interview data only, suggests that younger women shift to exclusive use of the British prestige variant. Part II expands the analysis to four variables and to broader speech repertoires for four individuals. The repertoire analysis shows the conclusions in Part I to be inaccurate, and instead reveals: (1) retention of Punjabi traits by young women in the home domain; (2) two types of repertoire - flexible and fused; (3) a gendered reversal in repertoire type over time; and (4) a network diversity basis for these differences. Unlike the initial variationist analysis, the use of repertoire analysis and a new Network Diversity Index leads to the discovery of a shift among lower-middle-class British Asians from traditional Punjabi to urban British social structures.},

The first wave of variation studies established broad correlations between linguistic variables and the macrosociological categories of socioeconomic class, gender, ethnicity, and age. The second wave employed ethnographic methods to explore the local categories and configurations that inhabit, or constitute, these broader categories. In both waves, variation was seen as marking social categories. This article sets out a theoretical foundation for the third wave, arguing that (a) variation constitutes a robust social semiotic system, potentially expressing the full range of social concerns in a given community; (b) the meanings of variables are underspecified, gaining more specific meanings in the context of styles, and (c) variation does not simply reflect, but also constructs, social meaning and hence is a force in social change.},

they originate as code-switches and are gradually integrated into recipient-language
grammar; and (3) the processes underlying code-switching and borrowing are the
same. Results do not support the assumptions. Few other-language items persist,
let alone increase. Linguistic integration is abrupt, not gradual. Speakers
consistently distinguish lone other-language items from multiword fragments on
each of five linguistic diagnostics tested. They borrow the former, and code-switch
the latter. Code-switches are not converted into borrowings; instead the decision to
code-switch or borrow is made at the moment the other-language item is accessed.
We explore the implications of these findings for understanding the processes by
which other-language incorporations achieve the status of native items and their
consequences for theories of code-switching and borrowing.},

	abstract = {Sociolinguistic variables have social evaluations and are used at different rates by different speakers. Variants become indexical of social traits and social identities, and are taken as defining ‘sociolects’ associated with identifiable groups: e.g., ‘working class speech’, ‘African-American English’. But since every speech community has many sociolinguistic variables, do the multiple variables cohere in forming sociolects? Thus if each variable has a variant considered ‘working class’, do working class speakers use all such variants simultaneously? Lectal coherence would imply that variables are correlated; if they are not, the cognitive and social reality of the ‘sociolect’ is problematic. This paper investigates intercorrelations among two phonological and two syntactic sociolinguistic variables in 20 speakers of Brazilian Portuguese. The results show considerable cross-variable correlation, but much of it may be explained by structural or grammatical coherence. There is some evidence of socially-motivated coherence, involving gender as well as status differentiation. Female speakers show stronger correlation among variables than males, while non-standard phonology seems to be indexical of male identity. The conclusion is that some sociolectal cohesion does exist, but it may be weaker and more multidimensional, than is commonly assumed. Future work on lects should problematize their coherence.},

Prior quantitative work on gender often treats this social variable as a female/male binary; we argue for a more nuanced approach. By clustering Twitter users, we find a natural decomposition of the dataset into various styles and topical interests. Many clusters have strong gender orientations, but their use of linguistic resources sometimes directly conflicts with the population-level language statistics. We view these clusters as a more accurate reflection of the multifaceted nature of gendered language styles. Previous corpus-based work has also had little to say about individuals whose linguistic styles defy population-level gender patterns. To identify such individuals, we train a statistical classifier, and measure the classifier confidence for each individual in the dataset. Examining individuals whose language does not match the classifier's model for their gender, we find that they have social networks that include significantly fewer same-gender social connections and that, in general, social network homophily is correlated with the use of same-gender language markers. Pairing computational methods and social theory thus offers a new perspective on how gender emerges as individuals position themselves relative to audiences, topics, and mainstream gender norms.},

The data of this study were collected within one year from status updates posted by the bilingua l users on their Facebook wall. They were then coded, analysed and categorised according to the functions they served in the Facebook context. The classification of the code-switching functions was based on Gumperz's (1982) conversational code- switching and supplemented by Zentella (1997), San (2009) and Montes-Alcalá’s (2007). Findings indicate that code- switching occurs in online interaction to serve quotation, addressee specification, reiteration, message qualification, clarification, emphasis, checking, indicating emotions, availability, principle of economy and free switching functions. This study hopes to provide insights on the code-switching phenomenon in asynchronous Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC).

	abstract = {In a multilingual society, language not only reflects culture and heritage, but also has implications for social status and the degree of integration in society. Different languages can be a barrier between monolingual communities, and the dynamics of language choice could explain the prosperity or demise of local languages in an international setting. We study this interplay of language and network structure in diverse, multi-lingual societies, using Twitter. In our analysis, we are particularly interested in the role of bilinguals. Concretely, we attempt to quantify the degree to which users are the "bridge-builders" between monolingual language groups, while monolingual users cluster together. Also, with the revalidation of English as a lingua franca on Twitter, we reveal users of the native non-English language have higher influence than English users, and the language convergence pattern is consistent across the regions. Furthermore, we explore for which topics these users prefer their native language rather than English. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest sociolinguistic study in a network setting.},

chapter examines the frequency of use of English lexical items in spoken
Wisconsin West Frisian and the phonological (non-)integration of these
lexemes. The data show a comparatively low frequency of borrowing compared
to other heritage communities, with a corresponding lack of phonological
integration. We categorize the consultants as ‘coordinate bilinguals,’ who have
simultaneous on-line access to lexical items from both language-specific lexicons.
Consultants’ balanced bilingualism minimizes the cross-linguistic transfer
of both lexical items and phonology while accessing lexical items from either
lexicon. This coordinate bilingualism account is supported by the sociolinguistic
evidence of a context-dependent diglossia – parallel to the Dutch-Frisian
diglossia in the Netherlands – in which both English and West Frisian were
restricted to specific domains. It is argued here that social context, as well as the
multiple-lexicon coordinate bilingualism model, can best account for these data.},

change across the lifespan: the apparent time construct, the adolescent peak, and
two different patterns of individual change. The apparent time construct is
attributed to a decline in flexibility toward language change over one’s lifetime;
this explanation is borne out in our model. The adolescent peak has been explained
by social networks: children interact more with caregivers a generation older until
later childhood and adolescence. We find that the peak also occurs with many
other network structures, so the peak is not specifically due to caregiver
interaction. The two patterns of individual change are one in which most
individuals change gradually, following the mean of community change, and
another in which most individuals have more categorical behavior and change
rapidly if they change at all. Our model suggests that they represent different
balances between the differential weighting of competing variants and degree of
accommodation to other speakers.},

However, less is known about the social role of variation in online writing. This article examines online writing variation in the context of audience design, focusing on affordances offered by Twitter that allow users to modulate a message's intended audience. We find that the frequency of nonstandard lexical variables is inversely related to the size of the intended audience: as writers target smaller audiences, the frequency of lexical variables increases. In addition, these variables are more often used in messages that are addressed to individuals who are known to be geographically local. This phenomenon holds not only for geographically differentiated lexical variables, but also for nonstandard variables that are widely used throughout the United States. These findings suggest that users of social media are attuned to both the nature of their audience and the social meaning of lexical variation and that they customize their self-presentation accordingly.},

These include monolingual communities where speakers have a common base in linguistic structure as well as complex multilingual communities with internal social divisions. Illustrations are drawn from the author’s research in French Canada and Papua New Guinea, and from Blanc’s (1964) study of Baghdad. Finally, the study of multilingual speech communities is linked to the understanding of how superposed linguistic knowledge is integrated across the lifespans of individual speakers and across communal groups. Even in such situations, members who do not share a language seek to communicate with each other, finding ways of doing so that respond to social opportunities and circumvent social barriers.},

First, we study the transformations occuring in songs from the traditional repertoire, through various audio renderings of the same songs. Second, we look at the way new songs, created in the traditional frame, address the lyrical content through old and contemporary themes, including the use of French language and bilingualism. This discussion is informed by interviews conducted with targeted musicians concerning their linguistic perceptions and respective artistic approaches. Thus, we eventually discover how, in addition to being a dance genre, Cajun and Creole music plays an essential role in the continued existence of French language in Louisiana.},

The theoretical construct introduced in this paper enables researchers to avoid this contradiction. ‘Ethnolinguistic repertoire’ is defined as a fluid set of linguistic resources that members of an ethnic group may use variably as they index their ethnic identities. This construct shifts the analytic focus from ethnic ‘language varieties’ to individuals, ethnic groups, and their distinctive linguistic features. It addresses problems of inter-group, inter-speaker, and intra-speaker variation, as well as debates about who should be considered a speaker of a dialect. This approach, which can also be applied to social groupings beyond ethnicity, is discussed in relation to other approaches and is supported with data on language use in African American, Latino, and Jewish communities in the United States.},

On the basis of historical research, ethnography, discourse analysis, and sociolinguistic interviews, the authors describe how a set of linguistic features that were once not noticed at all, then used and heard primarily as markers of socioeconomic class, have come to be linked increasingly to place and “enregistered” as a dialect called “Pittsburghese.” To explain how this has come about, the authors draw on the semiotic concept of “orders of indexicality.” They suggest that social and geographical mobility during the latter half of the twentieth century has played a crucial role in the process. They model a particularistic approach to linguistic and ideological change that is sensitive not only to ideas about language that circulate in the media but also to the life experiences of particular speakers; and they show how an understanding of linguistic variation, language attitudes, and the stylized performance of dialect is enhanced by exploring the historical and ideological processes that make resources for these practices available.},

Data from a Cardiff travel agency suggest that a speaker's stylistic repertoire can be statistically characterised using a method that combines Labov's frequency-counts of linguistic variants and Hymes' and others' taxonomies of situational components. A second study using subjects' responses to stylistic variation in the original data overcomes certain limitations inherent in the correlational method. It shows how style-shifting can be a dynamic resource for a speaker, not necessarily the automatic correlate of contextual features.},

	abstract = {The attention of linguists has only recently been drawn to the phenomenon of declining minority languages, and the field of inquiry has begun to prove to be a very fruitful one. Perhaps most importantly, dying languages change very quickly, thus providing a unique opportunity for the linguist to study language change. Furthermore, it is possible that some of the changes experienced by dying languages are "unnatural", which has important implications for how linguists handle data from such languages. In this study I examine a Cajun French-speaking community in the context of the study of language decline. This study is valuable not only in its contribution to research on language death in general, but also for its contribution to what is known of Cajun French, a little-studied variety in rapid decline which must therefore be documented soon or not at all. The research involved fieldwork in which I interviewed and taped over 80 speakers of Cajun French in the fall of 1993 and spring 1994, and transcribed these interviews. The study includes two components, a social one and a linguistic one. In the social component I examine changes across time in the patterns of usage of French and English in Louisiana, and examine some of the social correlates of language choice among bilinguals in Louisiana, such as the ethnicity (Native American versus Cajun French), sex, and age of the speaker. In the linguistic component I examine several aspects of the grammar of Cajun French in order to explore the new variety of the language which is emerging as the language declines. The emergent variety differs in some striking ways from that of the traditional norms of the community, and my study serves both to confirm some of the findings from studies of other declining languages, and to report some new patterns the details of which are not attested elsewhere.},

Most codeswitching studies do indeed have a social aspect, because they typically use naturally occurring performance data as their base. This book, however, is just as much a study in grammatical theory as a study of language in use. The specific research question addressed is this: when speakers alternate between two or more linguistic varieties, how free is this alternation from the structural point of view? Carol Myers-Scotton develops a model of the morphosyntactic constraints on codeswitching and concludes that the principles governing codeswitching are the same everywhere.},

The social psychological concept of affective meaning in language is measured in a single, bilingual culture and applied to the study of bilingualism, language shift, and the transmission of culture through language.  The data are collected from three generations of people identifying as Cajun in South Louisiana and a small comparative sample of elderly, non-Cajuns in the Southwest.  Quantitative, affective data - collected from all study participants - are bolstered by qualitative video- and audio-based data collected using anthropology-based field techniques from Cajun French/English bilingual participants, oral family histories collected from middle-aged participants, and survey data collected from high school student participants.  These data and personal accounts of lives, histories, and language conception and change provide the basis for answering the following research questions: 1) When using their different languages, do bilingual speakers hold different meanings for words that have the same translated meanings? 2) Can language shift be tracked affectively? 3) Does loss of language mean loss of culture?  The answer to each of these questions is yes.  It is my hope that the methods developed in this study will provide the basis for future language recording and analysis and cultural preservation projects.},

L'isolement des métayers francophones fut renforcé par une idéologie égalitaire. De ce milieu, la musique cadjine émergea comme l'un des indices de la société louisianaise francophone. Le déclin de la culture du coton entraîna des perturbations dans l'équilibre démographique entre le milieu agricole et le village, favorisant ainsi réclusion d'une classe marchande issue des rangs des agriculteurs. Au moyen d'une réinterprétation de la culture rurale en milieu urbain, cette nouvelle bourgeoisie chercha à garantir la survivance culturelle. Utilisant la radio, les journaux, et se servant de l'appui externe des « puristes » du folklore, ils exploitèrent d'une manière sélective les traits ethniques. Bien que promu sur la place publique, le français continua à se dévaloriser en milieu privé ou familial.L'impact de cette transformation diffère selon les groupes.

	abstract = {Evolution and propagation of the world's languages is a complex phenomenon, driven, to a large extent, by social interactions. Multilingual society can be seen as a system of interacting agents, where the interaction leads to a modification of the language spoken by the individuals. Two people can reach the state of full linguistic compatibility due to the positive interactions, like transfer of loanwords. But, on the other hand, if they speak entirely different languages, they will separate from each other. These simple observations make the network science the most suitable framework to describe and analyze dynamics of language change. Although many mechanisms have been explained, we lack a qualitative description of the scaling behavior for different sizes of a population. Here we address the issue of the language diversity in societies of different sizes, and we show that local interactions are crucial to capture characteristics of the empirical data. We propose a model of social interactions, extending the idea from, that explains the growth of the language diversity with the size of a population of country or society. We argue that high clustering and network disintegration are the most important characteristics of models properly describing empirical data. Furthermore, we cancel the contradiction between previous models and the Solomon Islands case. Our results demonstrate the importance of the topology of the network, and the rewiring mechanism in the process of language change.},

	abstract = {The goal of this research was to investigate the origins of social networks by examining the formation of children’s peer relationships in 11 preschool classes throughout the school year. We investigated whether several fundamental processes of relationship formation were evident at this age, including reciprocity, popularity, and triadic closure effects. We expected these mechanisms to change in importance over time as the network crystallizes, allowing more complex structures to evolve from simpler ones in a process we refer to as structural cascading. We analyzed intensive longitudinal observational data of children’s interactions using the SIENA actor-based model. We found evidence that reciprocity, popularity, and triadic closure all shaped the formation of preschool children’s networks. The influence of reciprocity remained consistent, whereas popularity and triadic closure became increasingly important over the course of the school year. Interactions between age and endogenous network effects were nonsignificant, suggesting that these network formation processes were not moderated by age in this sample of young children. We discuss the implications of our longitudinal network approach and findings for the study of early network developmental processes.},

	abstract = {Given a set of people and a set of events attended by them, we address the problem of measuring connectedness or tie strength between each pair of persons. The underlying assumption is that attendance at mutual events gives an implicit social network between people. We take an axiomatic approach to this problem. Starting from a list of axioms, which a measure of tie strength must satisfy, we characterize functions that satisfy all the axioms. We then show that there is a range of tie-strength measures that satisfy this characterization. A measure of tie strength induces a ranking on the edges of the social network (and on the set of neighbors for every person). We show that for applications where the ranking, and not the absolute value of the tie strength, is the important thing about the measure, the axioms are equivalent to a natural partial order. To settle on a particular measure, we must make a non-obvious decision about extending this partial order to a total order. This decision is best left to particular applications. We also classify existing tie-strength measures according to the axioms that they satisfy; and observe that none of the "self-referential" tie-strength measures satisfy the axioms. In our experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach; show the completeness and soundness of our axioms, and present Kendall Tau Rank Correlation between various tie-strength measures.},

Using survey data on friendship ties, we apply multiple indicator techniques to construct and validate measures of tie strength. We conclude that: (1) there may be two distinct aspects of tie strength, having to do with the time spent in a relationship and the depth of the relationship; (2) a measure of "closeness" or intensity is the best indicator of strength; (3) there are difficulties with frequency and duration of contact as indicators of strength; (4) predictors of strength (e.g., kinship, neighboring) are not especially strongly related to the concept; and (5) the constructed measures of strength, particularly the one of "time spent," are valid in that they are related to predictor variables in anticipated directions.},

Even so this allows an introduction not only to some of the deeper results but, more vitally, provides outlines of, and firm insights into, their proofs.

This book is an in-depth account of graph theory, written with such a student in mind; it reflects the current state of the subject and emphasizes connections with other branches of pure mathematics. The volume grew out of the author's earlier book, Graph Theory -- An Introductory Course, but its length is well over twice that of its predecessor, allowing it to reveal many exciting new developments in the subject. Recognizing that graph theory is one of several courses competing for the attention of a student, the book contains extensive descriptive passages designed to convey the flavor of the subject and to arouse interest. In addition to a modern treatment of the classical areas of graph theory such as coloring, matching, extremal theory, and algebraic graph theory, the book presents a detailed account of newer topics, including Szemer'edi's Regularity Lemma and its use, Shelah's extension of the Hales-Jewett Theorem, the precise nature of the phase transition in a random graph process, the connection between electrical networks and random walks on graphs, and the Tutte polynomial and its cousins in knot theory. In no other branch of mathematics is it as vital to tackle and solve challenging exercises in order to master the subject. To this end, the book contains an unusually large number of well thought-out exercises: over 600 in total. Although some are straightforward, most of them are substantial, and others will stretch even the most able reader.},

French in Louisiana has been spoken for hundreds of years, and, in spite of the decline of first-language speakers of the local Louisiana variety, contemporary efforts to promote and preserve the language have developed and expanded since the 1960’s. This historically disenfranchised language and culture strives to exist into the future through a variety of methods including immersion education, formal and informal community organization and growing interest in Louisiana’s heritage as a Francophone region. Through literature review and the collection of qualitative data, the author explores the current diversity of efforts to promote French in Louisiana and analyzes the causes and conditions of the language’s presence as of 2015. The findings suggest declining numbers of first-language speakers of the Louisiana variety but a possibility for a more significant presence of French language associated with Louisiana culture through the efforts analyzed.},

	abstract = {When natural language input contains grammatical forms that are used probabilistically and inconsistently, learners will sometimes reproduce the inconsistencies; but sometimes they will instead regularize the use of these forms, introducing consistency in the language that was not present in the input. In this paper we ask what produces such regularization. We conducted three artificial language experiments, varying the use of determiners in the types of inconsistency with which they are used, and also comparing adult and child learners. In Experiment 1 we presented adult learners with scattered inconsistency – the use of multiple determiners varying in frequency in the same context – and found that adults will reproduce these inconsistencies at low levels of scatter, but at very high levels of scatter will regularize the determiner system, producing the most frequent determiner form almost all the time. In Experiment 2 we showed that this is not merely the result of frequency: when determiners are used with low frequencies but in consistent contexts, adults will learn all of the determiners veridically. In Experiment 3 we compared adult and child learners, finding that children will almost always regularize inconsistent forms, whereas adult learners will only regularize the most complex inconsistencies. Taken together, these results suggest that regularization processes in natural language learning, such as those seen in the acquisition of language from non-native speakers or in the formation of young languages, may depend crucially on the nature of language learning by young children.},

An international team of fourteen specialists offer a wide-ranging analysis, from theoretical discussions of the origin of dialects, to detailed descriptions of the history of individual Standard English features. The volume ranges from Middle English to the present day, and looks at a variety of text types. It concludes that Standard English had no one single ancestor dialect, but is the cumulative result of generations of authoritative writing from many text types.},

Fieldork in non-metropolitan Mexico demonstrates the utility of our model, which can be applied across both urban and non-urban domains. It is compatible with the Milroys' central mechanism for the description of individual speech usage and group cohesion or susceptibility to change in terms of the social network. Based on linguistic variable types, this model has a hierarchy of four nested fields (speech community configurations) into which each individual is placed, according to his/her demonstrated recognition of the social evaluation associated with the variables. At the most local configuration, speakers demonstrate no knowledge of generally stigmatized variables; in the second, speakers register an awareness of stigmatized variables; in the third, an awareness of stigmatized and regional variables; and in the fourth, speakers model standard variants over regional ones. This model classifies the kinds of sociolinguistic variables that are pertinent in this social setting and also provides a structured manner for dealing with dialect contact dynamics.

This article seeks to fill these lacunae and explores the Yorùbá influences on these two neo-African religious traditions both from a contemporary and historical perspective, sorting through many misconceptions attached to the confusing and, for the most part, derogatory English term Voodoo. Interestingly, it is the powerful warrior spirits Eshu/Elegba and Ogun who proved to be the most resilient survivors of Yorùbá cosmology in the Haitian and New Orleanian diaspora.},

Roberts argues in Voodoo and Power, the religion was not a monolithic tradition handed down from African ancestors to their American-born descendants. Instead, a much more complicated patchwork of influences created New Orleans Voodoo, allowing it to move across boundaries of race, class, and gender. By employing late nineteenth and early twentieth-century first-hand accounts of Voodoo practitioners and their rituals, Roberts provides a nuanced understanding of who practiced Voodoo and why.Voodoo in New Orleans, a melange of religion, entrepreneurship, and business networks, stretched across the color line in intriguing ways. Roberts's analysis demonstrates that what united professional practitioners, or "workers," with those who sought their services was not a racially uniform folk culture, but rather the power and influence that Voodoo promised. Recognizing that social immobility proved a common barrier for their patrons, workers claimed that their rituals could overcome racial and gendered disadvantages and create new opportunities for their clients.Voodoo rituals and institutions also drew inspiration from the surrounding milieu, including the privations of the Great Depression, the city's complex racial history, and the free-market economy. Money, employment, and business became central concerns for the religion's practitioners: to validate their work, some began operating from recently organized "Spiritual Churches," entities that were tax exempt and thus legitimate in the eyes of the state of Louisiana. Practitioners even leveraged local figures like the mythohistoric Marie Laveau for spiritual purposes and entrepreneurial gain. All the while, they contributed to the cultural legacy that fueled New Orleans's tourist industry and drew visitors and their money to the Crescent City.},

twelve cases of discontinuity which have been documented in the speech of Franco-Ontarian adolescents residing in minority Francophone communities. We also attempt to account for the existence of these discontinuities and consider their implications for the concept of the speech community.},

	abstract = {The psycholinguistic theory of communication accommodation accounts for the general observation that participants in conversations tend to converge to one another's communicative behavior: they coordinate in a variety of dimensions including choice of words, syntax, utterance length, pitch and gestures. In its almost forty years of existence, this theory has been empirically supported exclusively through small-scale or controlled laboratory studies. Here we address this phenomenon in the context of Twitter conversations. Undoubtedly, this setting is unlike any other in which accommodation was observed and, thus, challenging to the theory. Its novelty comes not only from its size, but also from the non real-time nature of conversations, from the 140 character length restriction, from the wide variety of social relation types, and from a design that was initially not geared towards conversation at all. Given such constraints, it is not clear a priori whether accommodation is robust enough to occur given the constraints of this new environment. To investigate this, we develop a probabilistic framework that can model accommodation and measure its effects. We apply it to a large Twitter conversational dataset specifically developed for this task. This is the first time the hypothesis of linguistic style accommodation has been examined (and verified) in a large scale, real world setting. Furthermore, when investigating concepts such as stylistic influence and symmetry of accommodation, we discover a complexity of the phenomenon which was never observed before. We also explore the potential relation between stylistic influence and network features commonly associated with social status.},

Using tapes of daily conversations between three male-female couples as data, I present some observations on the ways conversation is controlled as well as the results of transcript analysis. The analysis describes the concrete strategies used by men and women in interaction. Women do more conversational work than men; this is the interactional manifestation of power relations. Finally, some suggestions are made on the importance of studying interactions in the areas of availability and maintenance of one's gender identity.},

	abstract = {Stylization is the knowing deployment of culturally familiar
styles and identities that are marked as deviating from those
predictably associated with the current speaking context. Dialect
stylization involves performing non-current-first-person personas
by phonological and related means, sometimes in play or parody.
Although these processes may seem to be very local, it is arguably
true that dialects are increasingly experienced in reflexive
and mediated environments that breed stylization. One of these
is light entertainment on radio; this article analyzes data
from English-language national radio broadcasts in Wales. Welshness
is self-consciously evoked in the data, partly through dialect
performance, where the variables (ou) and (ei) are a rich semiotic
resource, linked to nondialectal means of evoking Welsh cultural
stances and practices. Although stylization is a form of strategic
de-authentication, its ultimate relationship with authenticity
is complex. As a facet of cultural performance, stylization
can be part of a process of cultural reproduction, and I argue
that this is the best interpretation of the present data. As
a result, sociolinguistics may need to reconsider its assumptions
about cultural authenticity.},

In Contexts of Accommodation, accommodation theory is presented as a basis for sociolinguistic explanation, and it is the applied perspective that predominates this edited collection. The book seeks to demonstrate how the core concepts and relationships invoked by accommodation theory are available for addressing altogether pragmatic concerns. Accommodative processes can, for example, facilitate or impede language learners' proficiency in a second language as well as immigrants' acceptance into certain host communities; affect audience ratings and thereby the life of a television program; affect reaction to defendants in court and hence the nature of the judicial outcome; and be an enabling or detrimental force in allowing handicapped people to fulfill their communicative potential.},

In the model we propose, the speaker initiates the process by presenting or inviting a noun phrase. Before going on to the next contribution, the participants, if necessary, repair, expand on, or replace the noun phrase in an iterative process until they reach a version they mutually accept. In doing so they try to minimize their joint effort. The preferred procedure is for the speaker to present a simple noun phrase and for the addressee to accept it by allowing the next contribution to begin. We describe a communication task in which pairs of people conversed about arranging complex figures and show how the proposed model accounts for many features of the references they produced. The model follows, we suggest, from the mutual responsibility that participants in conversation bear toward the understanding of each utterance.
Résumé
Au cours d' une conversation, les interlocuteurs travaillent ensemble pour construire une référence définie. Dans le modèle proposè, le locuteur initie le processus en présentant un syntagme nominal. Avant de passer à la contribution suivante, les participants, si cela est nécessaire, corrigent, développent ou remplacent ce syntagme nominal au cours d'un processus itératif jusqu'a ce que soit atteinte une version que tout deux acceptent. En faisant cela ils essaient de minimiser l'effort conjoint. La procedure préférée consiste pour le locuteur à présenter un syntagme nominal simple et pour l'allocuteur d'accepter ce syntagme en donnant le feu vert pour l'échange suivant. Nous décrivons une tache de communication an cours de laquelle deux personnes discutent l'agencement de figures complexes et nous montrons comment le modele proposé rend compte de nombreux traits des références produites. Le modéle découle, selon notre suggestion, de la responsabilité mutuelle que les participants prennent pour que soit compris chaque énoncé durant la conversation.},

The principles are illustrated through                 examination of a variety of linguistic interactions.},

	url = {http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1317598/},
	abstract = {This study investigates the social differences of the
Persian language in Tehran. It is based on data collected
from sixty informants: forty adults balanced equally between
the two sexes and four educational groups with university,
secondary, primary and no education respectively, and twenty
schoolchildren from both sexes equally from families with
highest and lowest education. The social parameters are related
to fourteen phonological, morphological and syntactic variables.
This work is presented in five chapters.
Chapter One gives general background information on the
city of Tehran and its social structure. It also discusses the
history of the Persian language from early days and gives some
comments on the writing system.
Chapter Two is about the research in Tehran. It gives the
characteristics of the sample and the method of interview. It
also gives a short introduction on sociolinguistic variables as
well as the theoretical issues.
In Chapter Three the co-variation of the linguistic variables
and the social factors, such as class, sex and age, as well as
style, are discussed and shown by means of figures and tables.
Chapter Four is about the politeness system in Persian.
Here the pronouns and verbs and their variations are given.
The combination of these variations and their application in
terms of power and solidarity are also discussed.
Chapter Five gives an overview of the results of the analysis.
It discusses the various theoretical issues such as transition
probabilities, lexical diffusion, and the sociolinguistic
structure of Tehran in detail, and draws the final conclusion.},

	abstract = {This study is a response to the long-standing need -within the field of Applied Linguistics for a "better understanding of General Canadian English and for a quantitative documentation of its usage. This dissertation presents an analysis of a sample of this national language as spoken "by persons whose mother tongue is English and who were born and raised in the city of Ottawa. The analysis demonstrates that the informants vary their speech patterns according to the linguistic tasks which they are asked to perform. Further, the analysis demonstrates that variations in usage are correlated to age, sex,
And socio-economic status. 
An hour-long interview was conducted with one hundred informants by means of a questionnaire which was designed to elicit phonological, morphological, syntactic, semantic, and lexical responses while the informants were performing a number of language related tasks. Unlike several urban socio-dialectology surveys conducted recently, this survey analyses the speech characteristics of a broad range of the socio-economic structure from skid row through the middle classes to the lower upper class. It is thereby the first such survey dealing with Worth American English which includes the mainstream of society as well as the minority ethnic groups.
Prior to presenting the extensive data and evaluative comments on the co-variation of stylistic and sociological variation of Canadian English usage, a number of background subjects are dealt with. First, a review and evaluation of previous dialectology studies is presented. Second, the background of Ottawa's settlement patterns and present situation is discussed. Third, the development of Canadian English is traced through time so that this national dialect can be placed in relation to other dialects of the English language family. This is followed by a detailed account of those characteristics which distinguish
Canadian English from Northern American, its closest relative. The fourth subject dealt with is the methodology of the study itself.
Chapter 5 presents an analysis of the co-variation of 27 phonological segments and sociological and stylistic parameters. Our data forcefully prove our hypothesis of phonological and stylistic co-variation, with 20 of the 27 items demonstrating variation directly related to the degree of formality of the task performed by the informant. Similarly, our data prove our hypothesis of phonological and socio-economic co-variation.
In this case, 10 of the 27 items demonstrate ordered stratification. The upper classes use a much broader range of styles than do the lower classes. Our analysis also reveals important findings of sex and age differentiation in addition to a number of important phonological discoveries
.
Chapter 6 analyses the co-variation of grammatical, pronunciation, and vocabulary forms and sociological factors. The data demonstrate that 13 of 15 grammatical items, 25 of 48 pronunciation items, and 2 of 8 vocabulary items have clear and ordered socio-economic stratification. Prestige and stigmatized forms were designated according to usage patterns. These data also demonstrate sex and age differentiation; our female informants maintained the strongest class hierarchy, had the lowest frequency of stigmatized forms, and the highest frequency of prestige forms. Both Chapters 5 and 6 have a summary section which contains the important findings of their respective analyses.
The Conclusion contains a summary of the significant findings and suggestions for future studies. Appendices A to G contain the questionnaire,
the complete computer printout of the data, and tabular presentations
of paralinguistic and attitudinal observations.},

Our findings show journalists engaging earlier than non- journalists in the spread and the correction of false rumors. However, compared to other users, journalists are (proportionally) more likely to deny false rumors. Journalists are also more likely to author original tweets and to be retweeted—underscoring their continued role in shaping the news. Interestingly, journalists scored high on “power user” measures, but were distinct from other power users in significant ways—e.g. by being more likely to deny rumors.},

	abstract = {The ability to process the linguistic input in real time is crucial for successfully acquiring a language, and yet little is known about how language learners comprehend or produce language in real time. Against this background, we have conducted a detailed study of grammatical processing in language learners using experimental psycholinguistic techniques and comparing different populations (mature native speakers, child first language [L1] and adult second language [L2] learners) as well as different domains of language (morphology and syntax). This article presents an overview of the results from this project and of other previous studies, with the aim of explaining how grammatical processing in language learners differs from that of mature native speakers. For child L1 processing, we will argue for a continuity hypothesis claiming that the child's parsing mechanism is basically the same as that of mature speakers and does not change over time. Instead, empirical differences between child and mature speaker's processing can be explained by other factors such as the child's limited working memory capacity and by less efficient lexical retrieval. In nonnative (adult L2) language processing, some striking differences to native speakers were observed in the domain of sentence processing. Adult learners are guided by lexical–semantic cues during parsing in the same way as native speakers, but less so by syntactic information. We suggest that the observed L1/L2 differences can be explained by assuming that the syntactic representations adult L2 learners compute during comprehension are shallower and less detailed than those of native speakers.},

The initial assumption of this paper is that nominal appositions behave as nonreferring, nominal predicates. The comparison of fronted appositions and specificational sentences reveals that in both constructions, the fronted (nonreferential) phrase receives a list-reading, a type of interpretation typically associated with an event-type, stage-level predicate. It further appears that apposed nominals which include a null determiner are steadily associated with a stage-level reading, whatever their linear position with respect to their antecedent; contrastively, apposed nominals which include the overt indefinite determiner (un) are associated with an individuallevel readin. A correlate appears to exist between the type of determiner and the syntactic locus of the apposed nominal : the null determiner occurs in fronted appositions (even though these may be moved to the right), while the indefinite determiner occurs in postposed appositions. These descriptive results lead us to conclude that the null and indefinite determiners must have their own syntactic function, and more precisely, must correspond to some functional heads.},

But in Networked, Lee Rainie and Barry Wellman show how the large, loosely knit social circles of networked individuals expand opportunities for learning, problem solving, decision making, and personal interaction. The new social operating system of "networked individualism" liberates us from the restrictions of tightly knit groups; it also requires us to develop networking skills and strategies, work on maintaining ties, and balance multiple overlapping networks.Rainie and Wellman outline the "triple revolution" that has brought on this transformation: the rise of social networking, the capacity of the Internet to empower individuals, and the always-on connectivity of mobile devices. Drawing on extensive evidence, they examine how the move to networked individualism has expanded personal relationships beyond households and neighborhoods; transformed work into less hierarchical, more team-driven enterprises; encouraged individuals to create and share content; and changed the way people obtain information.

Several conclusions are noteworthy: First, and least controversially, we note that LAMSAS is dialectometrically challenging at least due to the range of field workers and questionnaires employed. Second, on the issue of which areas ought to be recognized, we note that our investigations tend to support a three-way North/South/Midlands division rather than a two-way North/South division, i.e. they tend to support Kurath and McDavid rather than Carver, but this tendency is not conclusive. Third, we extend dialectometric technique in suggesting means of dealing with alternate forms and multiple responses.},

	copyright = {All rights reserved},
	abstract = {Studies of Louisiana French, a language long spoken by people in Louisiana, almost unanimously lament the inevitable death of the language, yet very little
information exists on the strengths and weaknesses of the language in various media. These predictions are generally based only on the change in the number of speakers over
time obtained through census data (Bankston and Henry 1998; Henry 1997:186-187),
which is notoriously unreliable (Blyth 1997:28-29; Dubois 1997:47; Brown 1997:224).
Census data does not differentiate who in the house is speaking French nor to what extent
they speak French. The questions on the census are not necessarily consistent over time
nor entirely clear in a linguistic climate where the terms French, Cajun French, Louisiana
French, and Creole, may all mean different things to different people.

This thesis took a different approach by measuring the strength of Louisiana
French via its use in Cajun music. The language is used in the music often but its overall importance in defining the music, the fluency of the singers, and the form it takes—be it
clearly Louisiana French or a mixture of Standard French as well—have not been thoroughly analyzed before. Two conclusions were arrived at: Louisiana French is an integral aspect of Cajun music and the French being used is highly marked as being
Louisiana French. The music itself was defined using a method inspired by optimality theory, allowing the importance of French in the music to be compared to various other
musical and extramusical features. The quality of the language used in each recording was then examined to determine how native-like it was.},

We propose a set of new entropy-based measures for human communication dynamics represented within the temporal social network as event sequences. Using real world datasets and random interaction series of different types we find that real human contact events always significantly differ from random ones. This human distinctiveness increases over time and by means of the proposed entropy measures, we can observe sociological processes that take place within dynamic communities.},

Because it abstractly represents speaker interaction, this approach imposes a taxonomic distinction between stylistic and social constraints. By focussing on single variables in isolation, such accounts wrench individual variables out of the context that defines them. Recent accounts of style recognise the context-dependency of socialmeaning. We must therefore consider how a particular combination of linguistic and extralinguistic resources interact to produce an overall style that subsumes the traditional style/social constraint distinction. I explore how the styles created by a community of girls function to produce a system of distinction (Irvine 2001) in their high school, by considering how each group uses morphosyntactic and discourse-related variables to define themselves in relation to other social groups. The analysis reveals that sociolinguistic meaning is never achieved by a single group in isolation, but is the consequence of a collaborative negotiation of available resources. {\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater} Traditionnellement, les analyses sociolinguistiques isolent les variables individuelles et situent leur usage sur une \&\#x000E9;chelle de formalit\&\#x000E9;.

Next, the resulting interview transcripts were reviewed to explore player behaviors, attitudes, and opinions; the meanings they make; the social capital they derive; and the networks they form and to develop a typology of players and guilds. In keeping with current Internet research findings, players were found to use the game to extend real-life relationships, meet new people, form relationships of varying strength, and also use others merely as a backdrop. The key moderator of these outcomes appears to be the game's mechanic, which encourages some kinds of interactions while discouraging others. The findings are discussed with respect to the growing role of code in shaping social interactions.},

We tested the mutual intelligibility of 15 Chinese dialects functionally at the level of isolated words (word-intelligibility) and the level of sentences (sentence intelligibility). We collected data for each dialect by playing isolated words and sentences spoken in 15 Chinese dialects to 15 listeners. Word-intelligibility was determined by having listeners perform a semantic categorization task whereby words had to be classified as one of ten different categories such as body part, plant, animal, etc. Sentence intelligibility was estimated by having the listeners translate a target word in each sentence into their own dialect. We obtained 47,250 data (15×150×15 for the word part and 15×60×15 for the sentence part). We also had at our disposal structural similarity measures (lexical similarity, phonological correspondence) for each pair of the 15 Chinese dialects published by Cheng (Computational Linguistics \& Chinese Language Processing 1997, 2.1, pp. 41–72). Our general conclusion is that the degree of mutual intelligibility can be determined by both opinion and functional tests. These two subjective measures are significantly correlated with one another and can be predicted from objective measures (lexical similarity and phonological correspondence) equally well. However, functional intelligibility measures, especially at the sentence level, better reflect Chinese dialect classifications than opinion scores.},

	shorttitle = {What is "{NAS}"?},
	url = {http://search.proquest.com/docview/304281956/},
	abstract = {This dissertation investigates the theoretical problems and practical considerations inherent in the definition of a dialect and a language in the South Slavic linguistic region. Specifically, it focuses upon the place of the Macedonian language in what is generally recognized as the South Slavic dialect continuum--both from the perspective of the linguist and the perspective of the speaker. A concern of this study is a reconciliation of three apparent paradoxes in previous approaches to defining a language in a continuum situation: (1) from the linguist's perspective, languages exist in a continuum, but an ethnolinguistic group has discrete boundaries from the speaker's perspective; (2) a language is defined either by formal linguistic features or by its perceived sociopolitical status; and (3) linguistic boundaries are posited either on the basis of objective features or subjective features. A sociolinguistic approach facilitates this examination of the interrelationship between a language and ethnonational identity. The notion that perception and self-ascription play a constitutive role in ethnonational identity is explored. It is proposed that a language is the objective link (i.e., as objectified by its speakers) and one of the primary means by which ethnonational identity is understood by speakers of Macedonian. Moreover, a language, especially in its standard codified form, acquires a symbolic function for its speakers; the nature of a language as a symbolic institution has specific linguistic consequences for its speakers. Data for this study derives from the results of questionnaires and interviews conducted in Macedonia during a ten month period, September 1994-July 1995. The questionnaires and interviews center upon language attitudes toward the neighboring Slavic languages and toward linguistic variation. Two results emerge from the data: (1) Macedonian speakers perceive Serbian to be closer to Macedonian than Bulgarian in spite of the linguistic historical and grammatical-structural affinities between Macedonian and Bulgarian and (2) Macedonian speakers are more likely to accept elements which overlap with Macedonian if it occurs in a Serbian context than elements which overlap with Macedonian if it occurs in a Bulgarian context. These data contribute to several conclusions regarding (1) native speaker perceptions of the place of Macedonian within the South Slavic linguistic continuum; (2) a definition of the Macedonian language for its speakers that encompasses its linguistic, sociohistoric, and symbolic dimensions; (3) and a method for determining speech markers that may characterize a speaker as Macedonian. This process of recontextualizing the problem of defining a language within a dialect continuum situation gives rise to the concept of an ethnolect. A model of an ethnolect is proposed as a means to bridge the theoretical gaps created by previous approaches to language definitions and provide insight into how linguistic boundaries are constructed for the speaker. An ethnolect, it is argued, is constituted by a set of linguistic and nonlinguistic features; these features are perceived in a hierarchical arrangement which, by its nature, constructs a boundary. A partial hierarchy of linguistic features, interpreted as speech markers of identity, is proposed for Macedonian based on questionnaire and interview responses to specific linguistic features An ethnolect, then, offers a means of correlating sociolinguistic descriptors--status, prestige, and function--with linguistic descriptors--idiolect, dialect, and grammatical category--in a way that provides a comprehensive objective framework for studying and measuring the subjective dimensions of a language in the context of ethnonational identity.},

The constraints, expressing desirable (i.e., optimal) phonological states, evaluate possible candidate forms, selecting the optimal output. Any constraint may be violated by a surface form if it is overridden by a higherranked constraint; the ordinal sequence of constraints provides a weak quantification of constraint effects. Variability has been treated within OT by varying constraint orders. This model is analogous in several important respects to the variable rule model (VR) of Labov (1969) and Cedergren and Sankoff (1974). In VR, variable constraints express desirable phonological states which are variably realized on the surface, when not overridden by other constraints; constraints are probabilistically quantified. This article compares the OT and VR models, arguing that the VR model is superior on theoretical and empirical grounds: constraint effects in VR are stable, transparent, and learnable. Moreover, the probabilistic treatment of constraint effects allows VR to model successfully cases in which multiple violations of a single constraint lead to a cumulative reduction in likelihood of a form; such cases cannot be efficiently treated in OT.},

	abstract = {Rule- and usage-based models in phonology are difficult to reconcile: ‘rule’-based approaches (including generative and optimality models) rely on abstraction and seek to account for regularity and generality. Usage-based models, like exemplar theory, rely on concrete representations, eschewing abstraction; they typically seek to account for lexically differentiated phonological phenomena, including variability, gradience and probabilistic properties. An alternative that incorporates both generative productivity and quantitative precision is the “variable rule” (VR) model of sociolinguistic variation. VR preserves advantages of rule-based models, including abstraction and the capacity to represent categorical processes. But VR resolves many limitations of these formalisms using probabilistic quantification: any phonological process or constraint may be associated with a probability, which permits the treatment of variation and gradience. This paper cites evidence from variation in speech style, child language, and reanalysis across the life span showing that speakers have both discrete abstract and nondiscrete, variable elements of phonology. Variable processes provide a nondeterministic but recoverable link between these different representations.},

	abstract = {bro’Town is a popular animated comedy whose language is that of stylized performance. It deals with the adventures of a group of five teenage Pasifika boys growing up in Auckland, New Zealand, and showcases performances of the Englishes spoken by Polynesian immigrants and their descendants. A range of varieties are performed on the show by a handful of actors. We analyzed several linguistic variables in the speech of three of the main characters — the 14-year-old twins Vale and Valea, and their father Pepelo. Pepelo produces high levels of the vernacular features of DH-stopping and TH-fronting, consistent with his biography as a second-language speaker whose pronunciation is influenced by his native language, Samoan. His sons, as second-generation speakers, have these features too but at lower frequencies. The twins also differ from each other, with the streetwise Valea, who is more aligned with Pasifika youth culture, producing higher levels of the variables than the studious Vale. Pepelo produces unaspirated initial /p/s, again a Pasifika language feature, while his sons do not. Linking-/r/, however, appears to index a youth identity but not adult immigrant status. We conclude that performed varieties can reflect the linguistic production of a community in their selection of specific features. The quantitative patterns can be quite variable, but here succeed in indexing salient identities for their audiences.},

	abstract = {Le sentiment général à l'égard du français québécois oral, en particulier pour son aspect statut social, n'atteindrait toujours pas en matière d'appréciation la place réservée au français européen, notamment chez la population immigrante de Montréal qui le jugerait moins favorablement que sa contrepartie hexagonale (Kircher, 2012). Au Québec, le français de France et celui de Paris, plus particulièrement, ont par le passé été désignés comme les modèles du « bon français », alors que la variété québécoise a souvent hérité de jugements négatifs, d'un statut de langue non standard ou encore a été perçue comme une variété peu, ou pas prestigieuse (Lambert et coll., 1960; Lambert, 1967; d'Anglejan et Tucker, 1973; Lappin, 1982; Bouchard, 2002; Maurais, 2008; Kircher, 2012). Aujourd'hui encore, le débat n'est pas clos sur la nature endogène ou exogène que devrait revêtir la norme linguistique québécoise (Maurais, 2008; Bigot, 2011; Brousseau, 2011) et cette hésitation connaît des échos en classe de français langue seconde, où le français québécois serait dévalué (Archambault et Corbeille, 1982; Calinon, 2009). Dans la présente étude, nous avons observé les attitudes linguistiques d'apprenants de français langue seconde à Montréal face à la variation sociophonétique sur le plan dialectal France/Québec, mais aussi, sur le plan stylistique propre aux situations formelles et informelles. À l'aide de la technique du locuteur masqué (Lambert et coll., 1960), nous avons fait entendre et évaluer, par 43 participants, des locuteurs de France et du Québec que nous avions au préalable enregistrés, produisant exactement le même discours dans deux situations différentes; soit, sous quatre étiquettes – inconnues des participants : Québec formel, Québec informel, France formel, France informel. Les résultats que nous avons obtenus tendent clairement à démontrer que la variation stylistique a, plus fortement que ne l'a fait la variation dialectale, polarisé les jugements de nos participants. Nouvellement par rapport à Kircher (2012), les pistes québécoises (formelles) ont souvent été évaluées au haut de l'échelle. Parallèlement, et ceci teinte le résultat précédent, ces pistes québécoises formelles ont été plus souvent identifiées au français de France qu'à celui du Québec. Cet amalgame entre langue formelle et français européen, observé également chez Calinon (2009), nous renseigne aussi sur la perception qu'ont nos participants des styles et des variétés dialectales. Le portrait que nous tirons des attitudes linguistiques des apprenants en francisation interrogés est, en définitive, nuancé et détaillé.

A static community detection algorithm and a dynamic community evolution algorithm are included in the approach. At first, communities are initialized by constructing the core nodes chains, the nodes can be iteratively searched and divided into corresponding communities via the static community detection algorithm. For a dynamic network, an evolutionary process is divided into three phases, and behaviors of community evolution can be judged according to the changing situation of the core nodes chain in each community. Experiments show that the proposed approach can achieve accuracy and availability in the synthetic and real world networks.},

	abstract = {Many complex systems in nature and society can be described in terms of networks capturing the intricate web of connections among the units they are made of. A key question is how to interpret the global organization of such networks as the coexistence of their structural subunits (communities) associated with more highly interconnected parts. Identifying these a priori unknown building blocks (such as functionally related proteins, industrial sectors and groups of people) is crucial to the understanding of the structural and functional properties of networks. The existing deterministic methods used for large networks find separated communities, whereas most of the actual networks are made of highly overlapping cohesive groups of nodes. Here we introduce an approach to analysing the main statistical features of the interwoven sets of overlapping communities that makes a step towards uncovering the modular structure of complex systems. After defining a set of new characteristic quantities for the statistics of communities, we apply an efficient technique for exploring overlapping communities on a large scale. We find that overlaps are significant, and the distributions we introduce reveal universal features of networks. Our studies of collaboration, word-association and protein interaction graphs show that the web of communities has non-trivial correlations and specific scaling properties.},

Thanks to frequent changes in the activity and communication patterns of individuals, the associated social and communication network is subject to constant evolution. Our knowledge of the mechanisms governing the underlying community dynamics is limited, but is essential for a deeper understanding of the development and self-optimization of society as a whole. We have developed an algorithm based on clique percolation that allows us to investigate the time dependence of overlapping communities on a large scale, and thus uncover basic relationships characterizing community evolution. Our focus is on networks capturing the collaboration between scientists and the calls between mobile phone users. We find that large groups persist for longer if they are capable of dynamically altering their membership, suggesting that an ability to change the group composition results in better adaptability. The behaviour of small groups displays the opposite tendency—the condition for stability is that their composition remains unchanged. We also show that knowledge of the time commitment of members to a given community can be used for estimating the community’s lifetime. These findings offer insight into the fundamental differences between the dynamics of small groups and large institutions.},

In fact, historical changes to both Cajun and Creole identities have led to today’s conflation of terms that belies a much more complex state of affairs featuring considerable linguistic diversity. Furthermore, the focus on these two terms has ignored a third group of Francophones, American Indians. Linguistic fieldwork reveals that Cajuns, Creoles, and Indians all express their identities by manipulating the language differently, but that labels given are not always reliable indicators of the type of French spoken.},

We present cross-linguistic evidence that these mechanisms also operate in bidialectals. Thirty-two native German speakers who sometimes use the Öcher Platt dialect, and thirty-two native English speakers who sometimes use the Dundonian Scots dialect completed a dialect-switching task. Naming latencies were higher for switch than for non-switch trials, and lower for cognate compared to non-cognate nouns. Switch costs were symmetrical, regardless of whether participants actively used the dialect or not. In contrast, sixteen monodialectal English speakers, who performed the dialect-switching task after being trained on the Dundonian words, showed asymmetrical switch costs with longer latencies when switching back into Standard English. These results are reminiscent of findings for balanced vs. unbalanced bilinguals, and suggest that monolingual dialect speakers can recruit control mechanisms in similar ways as bilinguals.},

Ainsi, à l’aide du corpus Mougeon et Beniak, recueilli en 1978 au moyen d’entrevues enregistrées, il scrute les divers emplois des conjonctions ça fait que, so, alors et donc dans le parler des adolescents de North-Bay, Pembroke, Cornwall et Hawkesbury, en Ontario, qu’il met en rapport avec ceux des locuteurs montréalais, au Québec. L’auteur examine l’alternance entre ces quatre conjonctions en fonction de divers facteurs : la localité, l’appartenance socio-économique, le sexe, la fréquence de l’emploi du français et le registre (sujet abordé dans l’entrevue). Il relève des divergences dans l’emploi de ces marqueurs : par exemple, la tournure typique du français vernaculaire ( ça fait que ) est mieux préservée dans les communautés majoritaires ; une pression normative plus faible rend les minorités tolérantes à l’anglais et explique l’emprunt, plus ou moins fréquent de la conjonction so selon le milieu et la condition des locuteurs ; chez ceux qui sous-utilisent le français, on observe une tendance à la standardisation (emploi plus fréquent d’alors et de donc ).},

D’après les résultats d’analyses de type règle variable, le facteur réseau social est en mesure de prédire l’emploi des formes traditionnelles comme que, quand que et si que de manière plus stable que tout autre facteur extralinguistique, incluant la classe sociale. L’analyse des correspondances est utilisée pour opérationnaliser le facteur réseau social à partir des affiliations des sujets dans les domaines d’affiliation.

Résumé
This article reexamines the concept of social network used in variationist sociolinguistics by analyzing network structure in terms of different domains of affiliation that are associated with strong ties and with weak ties found inside and outside a speech community. The study presents the role of these ties in explaining morphosyntactic variation in the expressions that introduce adverbial clauses in the variety of Acadian French spoken in northeastern New Brunswick (Canada). Variable rule analyses show that social network is a more regular predictor of the traditional variants comme que, quand que, and si que than other social factors, including social class. Correspondence analysis is used to analyze social network structure on the basis of subjects’ affiliations with different domains. The study suggests that the explanation of sociolinguistic variation needs to include a closer examination of weak ties and that multivariate statistical techniques are appropriate for this kind of study.},

Regarded as a classic, and widely quoted, it has continued to arouse interest. Here now is his Creation Revisited, which retains the unsettling mixture of reductionist attitude and poetic style of the earlier work. Written for a wide readership, it is an engrossing exploration of the truly great questions of existence, such as why there are three dimension of space, why there is only one direction of time, how matter can emerge from nothing, and - what many regard as beyond our grasp - whether it is possible to speculate scientifically on the events that preceded the creation. Peter Atkins approaches these and other fundamental questions on the nature of the universe, and how it came into being without external intervention, with the view that there is nothing that cannot be understood. The path to our understanding is to peel away appearances to expose a core, a core which is always of unsurpassed simplicity. This book is intended for all readers with an interest in the nature of the Universe and the other great questions of existence.},

I hypothesize that only computable and decidable (in Gödel’s sense) structures exist, which alleviates the cosmological measure problem and may help explain why our physical laws appear so simple.

We consider mixing according to discrete characteristics such as language or race in social networks and scalar characteristics such as age. As a special example of the latter we consider mixing according to vertex degree, i.e., according to the number of connections vertices have to other vertices: do gregarious people tend to associate with other gregarious people? We propose a number of measures of assortative mixing appropriate to the various mixing types, and apply them to a variety of real-world networks, showing that assortative mixing is a pervasive phenomenon found in many networks. We also propose several models of assortatively mixed networks, both analytic ones based on generating function methods, and numerical ones based on Monte Carlo graph generation techniques. We use these models to probe the properties of networks as their level of assortativity is varied. In the particular case of mixing by degree, we find strong variation with assortativity in the connectivity of the network and in the resilience of the network to the removal of vertices.},

The problem of detecting and characterizing this community structure is one of the outstanding issues in the study of networked systems. One highly effective approach is the optimization of the quality function known as "modularity" over the possible divisions of a network. Here I show that the modularity can be expressed in terms of the eigenvectors of a characteristic matrix for the network, which I call the modularity matrix, and that this expression leads to a spectral algorithm for community detection that returns results of demonstrably higher quality than competing methods in shorter running times. I illustrate the method with applications to several published network data sets.},

We then relate its conclusions to compatible investigations of learning and of innovation to argue that conventional descriptions of jobs mask not only the ways people work, but also significant learning and innovation generated in the informal communities-of-practice in which they work. By reassessing work, learning, and innovation in the context of actual communities and actual practices, we suggest that the connections between these three become apparent.

Opinion and behavior are more homogeneous within than between groups, so people connected across groups are more familiar with alternative ways of thinking and behaving. Brokerage across the structural holes between groups provides a vision of options otherwise unseen, which is the mechanism by which brokerage becomes social capital. I review evidence consistent with the hypothesis, then look at the networks around managers in a large American electronics company. The organization is rife with structural holes, and brokerage has its expected correlates. Compensation, positive performance evaluations, promotions, and good ideas are disproportionately in the hands of people whose networks span structural holes. The between‐group brokers are more likely to express ideas, less likely to have ideas dismissed, and more likely to have ideas evaluated as valuable. I close with implications for creativity and structural change.},

This study draws on social network theory to examine the relationship between observable structural group characteristics and individual perceptions of group cohesion. Leveraging Facebook data, we extracted and partitioned the social networks of 109 participants into groups using a modularity algorithm. We then surveyed perceptions of cohesion, and computed group density and size using social network analysis. Out of six linear mixed effects models specified, a random intercept and fixed slope model with group size as a predictor of perceived group cohesion emerged as best fitting. Whereas group density was not linked to perceived cohesion, size had a small negative effect on perceived cohesion, suggesting that people perceive smaller groups as more cohesive. We discuss the potential of social network analysis, visualization tools, and Facebook data for advancing research on groups.},

Empirical analyses and simulation models reveal new types of ties, as well as the conventional variety, that open promising research avenues.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.07649},
	abstract = {Many real-world networks are representations of dynamic systems with interactions that change over time, often in uncoordinated ways and at irregular intervals. For example, university students connect in intermittent groups that repeatedly form and dissolve based on multiple factors, including their lectures, interests, and friends. Such dynamic systems can be represented as multilayer networks where each layer represents a snapshot of the temporal network. In this representation, it is crucial that the links between layers accurately capture real dependencies between those layers. Often, however, these dependencies are unknown. Therefore, current methods connect layers based on simplistic assumptions that cannot capture node-level layer dependencies. For example, connecting every node to itself in other layers with the same weight can wipe out essential dependencies between intermittent groups, making it difficult or even impossible to identify them. In this paper, we present a principled approach to estimating node-level layer dependencies based on the network structure within each layer. We implement our node-level coupling method in the community detection framework Infomap and demonstrate its performance compared to current methods on synthetic and real temporal networks. We show that our approach more effectively constrains information inside multilayer communities so that Infomap can better recover planted groups in multilayer benchmark networks that represent multiple modes with different groups and better identify intermittent communities in real temporal contact networks. These results suggest that node-level layer coupling can improve the modeling of information spreading in temporal networks and better capture their dynamic community structure.},

We focus on two contrasting approaches to the identification of code-switching vs. borrowing by Poplack and Meechan [1] and Myers-Scotton [2,3]. For Poplack the distinction is based on linguistic integration and for Myers-Scotton on frequency. We show how what is a definition for one is a hypothesis for the other, and vice versa. Overcoming this apparent incommensurability requires a theory-independent approach in which we define the unit of analysis as “donor-language items” rather than switches or borrowings. Using this unit of analysis in the analysis of English-origin verbs in a Welsh corpus, we examine the assumptions behind the contrasting definitions of CS vs. borrowing. First we consider whether it is possible to identify linguistic integration in an unequivocal, categorical way and secondly whether linguistic integration is related to frequency of usage. We show that the identification of linguistic integration depends on the test used and that both frequency of usage and listedness play roles in the integration of English donor-language items in Welsh. In this way we argue that we achieve a theory-independent approach and go some way towards overcoming incommensurability.},

Reporting on evidence from natural conversation, diachronic change, variability, child language acquisition and psycholinguistic experimentation the original articles in this book support two major principles. First, the content of peoples interactions consists of a preponderance of subjective, evaluative statements, dominated by the use of pronouns, copulas and intransitive clauses. Second, the frequency with which certain items and strings of items are used has a profound influence on the way language is broken up into chunks in memory storage, the way such chunks are related to other stored material and the ease with which they are accessed to produce new utterances.},

It is shown that particular instances of constructions can acquire their own pragmatic, semantic, and phonological characteristics. In addition, it is argued that high-frequency instances of constructions undergo grammaticization processes (which produce further change), function as the central members of categories formed by constructions, and retain their old forms longer than lower-frequency instances under the pressure of newer formations.

people, is the process of inheritance that underlies linguistic evolution. To understand
how language transmission works we need a mechanistic understanding based on
empirical evidence of lasting change of language usage. Here, we analysed 200
million online conversations to investigate transmission between individuals. We
 nd that frequency of word usage is inherited over conversations, not just the binary
presence or absence of a word in a person's lexicon. We propose a mechanism for
transmission whereby for each word someone encounters there is a chance they will
use it more often. Using this mechanism, we measure that for one word in around
every hundred someone encounters, they will use that word more frequently. Since
more commonly used words are encountered more often, this means that it is the
frequencies of words which are copied. Beyond this, our measurements indicate that
this per-encounter mechanism is neutral and applies without any further distinction
as to whether a word encountered in a conversation is commonly used or not. An
important consequence of this is that frequencies of many words can be used in
concert to observe and measure language transmission, and our results con rm this.
These results indicate that our mechanism for transmission can be used to study
language patterns and evolution within populations.},

American English tweets. People vary in their use of eyes, mouth shape, face direction, and whether or not
they represent a nose in the face. And we see these in groups other than smiles—in variants of frowns and
winks, for example. This paper focuses on nose and non-nose users, demonstrating that the variants
correspond to different types of users, tweeting with different vocabularies. Emoticons are not simply
representations of internal emotional states. They are more interactive in nature, positioning authors and
audiences around propositions. The meaning of a given emoticon goes beyond its affective stance. For
example, emoticons have variants that have greater or lesser affinities to standard language. Researchers who
are interested in style, stance, affect, computer mediated communication, variation, context, and sentiment

As teenagers, they used morpho-syntactic features of AAVE voraciously. But as working adults, these women distance themselves from their teenage activities and social networks, and display a considerably reduced vernacular usage that accords with their articulated concern to get ahead. The diachronic interpretation that best characterizes their transformation is age-grading rather than generational change, since change at the individual level is accompanied by stability at the community level. The picture is complicated by intermediate recordings showing that one of the speakers is a stylistic chameleon, capable since her teenage years of varying copula absence rates depending on addressee, topic, and projected persona. But the age-grading interpretation of change at the individual level remains valid based on the evidence of her reduced use of habitual be2, and third singular present tense -s absence. The case highlights the importance of paying more attention to stylistic variation and including more than two time points in sociolinguistic studies of change in real and apparent time. (English)},

People who hear monophthongal /aw/ as an index of localness are unlikely to have this feature in their own speech, and many of the people who do monophthongize /aw/ do not associate this variant with localness. Exploring how four of these participants talk about this feature and its meanings, we show that the indexical meanings of speech features can vary widely within a community, and we illustrate the danger of confusing the meaning assigned by hearers to a linguistic form with the meaning users would assign to it. We suggest that a phenomenological approach, attending to the multiplicity and indeterminacy of indexical relations and to how such relations arise historically and in lived experience, can lead to a more nuanced account of the distribution of social meanings of variant forms than can studies of perception or production alone.},

Advancing recent approaches to variation which treat linguistic features as stylistic resources for constructing social meaning, I draw on an analysis of the discourse contexts in which falsetto appears to illustrate that the feature carries expressive connotations.

	abstract = {Summary
The purpose of this exploratory study was to examine the relationship between undergraduate vocal music majors' diction acquisition abilities for singing in a nonnative language (as rated both by themselves and by their studio voice teachers) and their scores on an objective test of phonemic and stress perception. Ten students with varying levels of university voice training served as participants. The results showed significant negative correlations between each of the teachers' four ratings and the students' scores on the phonemic awareness subtest. In addition, 20\% of the students demonstrated evidence of underdeveloped phonemic awareness skills, as indicated by their below average test performance. Considerable individual differences were also observed in the students' abilities to track phonemes within a sequence of phonemes, count and track syllables within a sequence of syllables, and track combinations of phoneme and syllable changes in sequence, as evidenced by subtest performance scores. These findings corroborate existing reports which indicate that approximately 30\% of the population does not fully develop phonemic awareness skills in the absence of special training. The findings support the utility of this objective test of phonemic and stress perception as a means of identifying students who will have difficulty with diction acquisition, and point to possibilities for pretraining to improve their response to diction instruction.},

A recurrent theme is the large degree of variation between bilingual children. This variation in how children develop bilingually reflects the variation in their language learning environments. Positive attitudes from the people in bilingual children's language learning environments and their recognition that child bilingualism is not monolingualism-times-two are the main ingredients ensuring that children grow up to be happy and expert speakers of two languages.},

Questionnaire data were collected in 1,899 families in which at least one of the parents spoke a language other than the majority language. Each questionnaire asked about the home language use of a family consisting of at least one parent and one child between the ages of 6 and 10 years old. The results show that the children in these families all spoke the majority language, but that minority language use was not universal. Differences in parental language input patterns used at home correlated with differences in child minority language use. Home input patterns where both parents used the minority language and where at most one parent spoke the majority language had a high chance of success. The "one parent-one language" strategy did not provide a necessary nor sufficient input condition. Implications for bilingual families are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

HPSG provides an integration of key ideas from the various disciplines of cognitive science, drawing on results from diverse approaches to syntactic theory, situation semantics, data type theory, and knowledge representation. The result is a conception of grammar as a set of declarative and order-independent constraints, a conception well suited to modelling human language processing.  This self-contained volume demonstrates the applicability of the HPSG approach to a wide range of empirical problems, including a number which have occupied center-stage within syntactic theory for well over twenty years: the control of "understood" subjects, long-distance dependencies conventionally treated in terms of wh-movement, and syntactic constraints on the relationship between various kinds of pronouns and their antecedents. The authors make clear how their approach compares with and improves upon approaches undertaken in other frameworks, including in particular the government-binding theory of Noam Chomsky.},

It suggests that a transformation of linguistic differences into ethnolect-codes quickly falls prey to homogenizing groups and their language use, obscures speakers' styling practices as well as the relations between “ethnolect” and standard language speakers. Furthermore, “ethnolect” as an analytical concept buttresses the idea that linguistic practices are caused by ethnicity, when it is more likely to assume language use is shaped by how speakers interpret prevailing representations of ethnicity and style their language use in relation to that. As an alternative, I argue that ethnolects be viewed as representations of particular ways of speaking that do not necessarily correspond to systematic linguistic practices. Sociolinguists therefore need to investigate how local and general perceptions of ways of speaking lead to specific styling practices...},

We obtain exact solutions for a simple version of the model, finding that under general conditions only three classes of collective dynamics exist. Furthermore, we find that, for a given length of memory, the class into which a particular system falls is determined by only two parameters. Our model suggests novel measures for assessing the susceptibility of a population to large contagion events, and also a possible strategy for inhibiting or facilitating them.},

Beginning with a frequency distribution of thresholds, the models allow calculation of the ultimate or "equilibrium" number making each decision. The stability of equilibrium results against various possible changes in threshold distributions is considered. Stress is placed on the importance of exact distributions distributions for outcomes. Groups with similar average preferences may generate very different results; hence it is hazardous to infer individual dispositions from aggregate outcomes or to assume that behavior was directed by ultimately agreed-upon norms. Suggested applications are to riot behavior, innovation and rumor diffusion, strikes, voting, and migration. Issues of measurement, falsification, and verification are discussed.},

	abstract = {It is reasonable to suppose that individuals use the number of firends that their friends have as one basis for determining whether they, themselves, have an adequate number of friends. This article shows that, if individuals compare themselves with their friends, it is likely that most of them will feel relatively inadequate. Data on friendship drawn from James Coleman's (1961) classic study The Adolescent Society are used to illustratite the phenomenon that most people have fewer friends have. The logic underlying the phenomenon is mathematically explored, showing that the mean number of friends of friends is always greater than the mean number of friends of individuals. Further analysis shows that the proportion of individuals who have fewer friends than the mean number of friends their own friends have is affected by the exact arrangement fo friendships in a social network. This disproportionate experiencing of friends with many friends is related to a set of abstractly similar "class size paradoxes" that includes such diverse phenomena as the tendencies for college students to experience the mean class size as larger than it actually is and for people to experience beaches and parks as more crowded than they usually are.},

People, however, rarely have global knowledge of the states of others, but must estimate them from the local observations of their social contacts. Network structure can significantly distort individual’s local observations. Under some conditions, a state that is globally rare in a network may be dramatically over-represented in the local neighborhoods of many individuals. This effect, which we call the “majority illusion,” leads individuals to systematically overestimate the prevalence of that state, which may accelerate the spread of social contagions. We develop a statistical model that quantifies this effect and validate it with measurements in synthetic and real-world networks. We show that the illusion is exacerbated in networks with a heterogeneous degree distribution and disassortative structure.},

We have written a program for general link parsing and written a link grammar for the English language. The performance of this preliminary system -- both in the breadth of English phenomena that it captures and in the computational resources used -- indicates that the approach may have practical uses as well as linguistic significance.

Many of the difficulties are caused by longstanding confusions between the logical domain of science and grammar and the physical domain of sound waves and the people who speak and understand.In this book, therefore, the last impediments of tradition, the ancient semiotic-grammatical foundations of linguistics, are set aside. We move into the physical domain, where theories and hypotheses can be tested against observations of the physical reality. Here new foundations are laid that are fully consonant with modern science as practiced in physics, chemistry, and biology.On these foundations is built a structure of testable specific dynamic causal laws of communicative behavior that provides support for treating previously recalcitrant context-dependent semantic, pragmatic, interactive, rhetorical, and literary phenomena. The central role of context in the foundations of the theory provides the insights of scientific lawfulness while still honoring the particularity of situations celebrated in the humanities.},

The Sui people, an indigenous minority of southwest China, have marriage customs requiring that a wife and husband have different clan origins, and the wife permanently immigrates to the husband's village at the time of marriage. Due to subtle interclan dialect variation, a married woman may have different dialect features than her husband and other local villagers. This study presents an acoustic analysis of such clan-level variation in lexical tone, a sociotonetic analysis. Results show that the immigrant women maintain the tone variants of their home clan dialects to a high degree despite spending a decade or more in the husband's village, thus illustrating a case where linguistic identity is maintained in the face of close, long-term contact.},

Following forewords by the translator and the Prague Linguistic Circle is the author's introduction to phonology and phonetics, and phonology and phonostylistics. Contents of the first part of this work, "The Theory of Distinctiveness; The Distinctive or Meaning-differentiating Function of Sound" are the following chapters: (1) Basic Notions; (2) Rules for the Determination of Phonemes; (3) Logical  Classification of Distinctive Oppositions; (4) Phonological Classes of Distinctive Oppositions; (5) Types of Neutralization of Distinctive Oppositions; (6) Phoneme Combinations; and (7) Phonological Statistics. Chapters in Part II, "The Theory of Delimitative Elements; The Delimitative Function of Sound" are (1) Preliminary Remarks; (2) Phonemic and Nonphonemic Boundary Signals; (3) Individual Signals and Group Signals; (4) Positive and Negative Boundary Signals; and (5) The Use of Boundary Signals.

Male and female teenagers presented themselves similarly in their blogs, often revealing personal information such as their real names, ages, and locations. Males more so than females used emoticons, employed an active and resolute style of language, and were more likely to present themselves as gay. The results suggest that teenagers stay closer to reality in their online expressions of self than has previously been suggested, and that these explorations involve issues, such as learning about their sexuality, that commonly occur during the adolescent years.},

The internet proliferation among senior users is also rapidly increasing. In this demographic trend, though younger people’s online activities have heavily been studied, how senior users engage in online activities needs research (Smith 2014) both in the US and Japan. This study specifically examines understudied senior users’ linguistic behavior online from a sociolinguistic perspective (Coupland 2004).This paper is comprised of two parts. Part I makes a quantitative discussion on differences in linguistic and discourse specific features of emoticons between older and younger users for both genders, with respect to their diary-type blogs on everyday topics. Part II makes a qualitative analysis on blogs that discusses a specific topic, moral harassment, and examines how blogging on this particular topic differs from blogging on everyday topics, the latter of which comes from a subset used for the quantitative analyses.The study finds emoticon as the most salient feature that distinguishes younger and older men’s and women’s blogging, and blog topics as a determining factor on emoticon uses.},

Many algorithms have been proposed so far, but none of them has been subjected to strict tests to evaluate their performance. Most of the sporadic tests performed so far involved small networks with known community structure and/or artificial graphs with a simplified structure, which is very uncommon in real systems. Here we test several methods against a recently introduced class of benchmark graphs, with heterogeneous distributions of degree and community size. The methods are also tested against the benchmark by Girvan and Newman [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 99, 7821 (2002)] and on random graphs. As a result of our analysis, three recent algorithms introduced by Rosvall and Bergstrom [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 104, 7327 (2007); Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 105, 1118 (2008)], Blondel et al. [J. Stat. Mech.: Theory Exp. (2008), P10008], and Ronhovde and Nussinov [Phys. Rev.

The algorithm, which we refer to as a smart local moving algorithm, takes advantage of a well-known local moving heuristic that is also used by other algorithms. Compared with these other algorithms, our proposed algorithm uses the local moving heuristic in a more sophisticated way. Based on an analysis of a diverse set of networks, we show that our smart local moving algorithm identifies community structures with higher modularity values than other algorithms for large-scale modularity optimization, among which the popular “Louvain algorithm”. The computational efficiency of our algorithm makes it possible to perform community detection in networks with tens of millions of nodes and hundreds of millions of edges. Our smart local moving algorithm also performs well in small and medium-sized networks. In short computing times, it identifies community structures with modularity values equally high as, or almost as high as, the highest values reported in the literature, and sometimes even higher than the highest values found in the literature.},

	abstract = {Finding modules, or clusters, in networks currently attracts much attention in several domains. The most studied criterion for doing so, due to Newman and Girvan [Phys. Rev. E 69, 026113 (2004)], is modularity maximization. Many heuristics have been proposed for maximizing modularity and yield rapidly near optimal solution or sometimes optimal ones but without a guarantee of optimality. There are few exact algorithms, prominent among which is a paper by Xu et al. [Eur. Phys. J. B 60, 231 (2007)]. Modularity maximization can also be expressed as a clique partitioning problem and the row generation algorithm of Grötschel and Wakabayashi [Math. Program. 45, 59 (1989)] applied. We propose to extend both of these algorithms using the powerful column generation methods for linear and non linear integer programming. Performance of the four resulting algorithms is compared on problems from the literature. Instances with up to 512 entities are solved exactly. Moreover, the computing time of previously solved problems are reduced substantially.},

A variationist approach to rates of overt pronouns and variable and constraint hierarchies, comparing speakers from different dialect regions (Caribbeans vs. Mainlanders) and different generations (those recently arrived vs. those born and/ or raised in New York), reveals the influence of English on speakers from both regions. In addition, generational changes in constraint hierarchies demonstrate that Caribbeans and Mainlanders are accommodating to one another. Both dialect and language contact are shaping Spanish in New York City and promoting, in the second generation, the formation of a New York Spanish speech community.},

	abstract = {The influence of linguistic and social factors on (r) in Boston and two New Hampshire towns is described. The preceding vowel and geographic, ethnic, and age-related differences were found to have strong effects. In comparison to Bostonians, New Hampshire speakers exhibit a higher rate of rhoticity, and fewer factors constrain their variability. Younger speakers are more rhotic than older speakers, as are more educated speakers and those in higher linguistic marketplace positions. This study demonstrates that these patterns fit the transmission (within Boston) and diffusion (to New Hampshire) framework (Labov, 2007) only with the addition of accommodation theory (Niedzielski \& Giles, 1996), which connects our linguistic findings to evidence that many New Hampshire residents do not identify with Boston. The effects on (r) in other studies are compared to determine which effects are particular to individual communities (nonuniversal) and which occur across all communities examined. The nonuniversal effects are therefore available as measures of contact-induced change. This study introduces a method for quantitatively comparing the amount of change between communities.},

	abstract = {This dissertation explores the evolution of African American Vernacular English (AAVE) during this century in a rural Southern community, here called "Springville," Texas, by investigating the distribution of invariant be, copula deletion, the loss of third person verbal -s, and the use of had + past as a simple past form in the speech of its residents.
The study analyzes tape-recorded data representing several generations of speech in one community and explores the cultural, social, and historical contexts within which that speech has developed. The fieldwork used principally focuses on recordings at sites rather than with individuals, making it possible for fieldworkers to become participant-observers. The recordings are then the natural interactions of community members with each other, rather than with fieldworkers.
The data show a trend towards the acquisition of urban vernacular features for speakers born after World War II. In addition, this dissertation documents real time acquisition of the urban vernacular by reporting on data from a five-year longitudinal study of a Springville child/adolescent. These data suggest that innovations in Springville speech first develop in the city and subsequently spread to the country only as speakers extend and solidify their urban social network ties. The analysis indicates that age-grading is not a plausible explanation for the use of urban vernacular forms; in fact, the data show that as speakers get older they acquire more, not fewer, vernacular features, and use these features more frequently.
Changes in the present and past tense systems documented for Springville speech strongly support Bailey's (1993) hypothesis that demographic shifts in the South, resulting from World War II, have had a dramatic effect on Southern AAVE. The Springville data further suggest that grammatical changes which cluster around World War II, and the continuing changes after the war, provide additional support for the divergence hypothesis.},

This indexical function of variation can contribute to the advancement of ongoing linguistic change. Style shifting in individual sociolinguistic interviews is an indirect indication of social meaning, but the clearest demonstrations are found in studies of speakers in a range of social contexts. We explore and clarify the nature of social meaning in variation, and its relation to linguistic change. Phonological variables are most readily adapted to convey social meaning by their frequency, flexibility and freedom from referential functions. After providing several kinds of evidence of social meaning in phonological variation, we argue that meaning accrues specifically to concrete sounds – to phonetic elements – and not to the phonological structures in which those sounds participate. Mergers, near mergers, splits, chain shifts and parallel shifts are not generally objects of social perception, conscious or unconscious, and are motivated by more abstract principles of change.},

The analyses are based on fieldwork in an Ecuadorian sierra community characterized by ethnic revitalization. Among adult comuneros, the vernacular is seen as an essential part of their Indian cultural heritage. In the children's daily lives, the adults, particularly women and the elderly, speak Quichua among themselves, yet children are not addressed in the vernacular by either parents or elder siblings, and those under 10 years of age are generally more or less monolingual in Spanish. The paradoxical mismatch between ideology and daily practices -- the ethnic revitalization paradox -- is analyzed in light of Quichua speaking practices in intergenerational encounters, and in children's play dialogues. Ultimately, being Quichua means something different to members of each generation.},

We show second-generation speakers exhibit a more rigid word order compared to their newly arrived first-generation peers, more often preferring subjects in the preverbal position, and we explain that this increase in word order rigidity among our second-generation can be attributed, in large part, to their increased use of and contact with English. We further posit that the difference in subject placement across generations can be explained by the different context of acquisition since the Spanish that these second-generation speakers are exposed to contains both a higher rate of overt pronouns and a higher rate of preverbal subjects.},

Owned and managed by British industrialists, the mine recruited almost exclusively migrant workers to a remote fjord in the Norwegian periphery, many of them Kven from northern Finland and Sweden. In a multi-layered approach, the study sketches multilingual work practices, policy-making, and the discursive positioning of diversity, and explores the company's management of the relationships between capital, community, and nation-state. It reveals the company's flexible approach towards diversity governed by economic interest. (Workplace multilingualism, mining, Kven, Norway, historical)*},

Results reveal a change in apparent time for all analyzed variables, indicating the CVS's progression through the community, though not as robust as in urban, coastal areas. Additionally, we provide evidence that shifting patterns for different vowels are structured by the ideological divide between town and country. Thus, as the CVS spreads through Redding, speakers utilize particular features of the shift differently, negotiating identities relevant in California's nonurban locales.},

So what do we do under these conditions of uncertainty? Because relatively proficient L2 speakers have access to the grammar and lexicon of each language when comprehending words and sentences or when planning spoken utterances, and because the recent research suggests that these linguistic systems are not entirely independent, there is a critical question about how the knowledge of two languages affects basic aspects of language processing. In this article, I review how eye-tracking methodology has been used as a tool to address this question. I begin by discussing why eye movements are a useful methodology in language processing research, and I provide a description of one experimental paradigm developed to explore eye movements during reading. Second, I present recent developments in the use of eye tracking to study L2 spoken-language comprehension. I also highlight the importance of using multiple measures of online sentence processing by discussing results obtained using a moving window task and eye-tracking records while L2 speakers read syntactically ambiguous relative clauses. Next, I discuss research investigating syntactic processing when L2 speakers process mixed language. I end with suggestions for future research directions.},

	abstract = {This eye-tracking study tests the hypothesis that more attention leads to more learning, following claims that attention to new language elements in the input results in their initial representation in long-term memory (i.e., intake; Robinson, 2003; Schmidt, 1990, 2001).
Twenty-eight advanced learners of English read English texts that contained 12 targets for incidental word learning. The target was a known word (control condition), a matched pseudoword, or that pseudoword preceded or followed by the known word (with the latter being a cue to the pseudoword's meaning). Participants' eye-fixation durations on the targets during reading served as a measure of the amount of attention paid (see Rayner, 2009).
Results indicate that participants spent more time processing the unknown pseudowords than their matched controls. The longer participants looked at a pseudoword during reading, the more likely they were to recognize that word in an unannounced vocabulary posttest. Finally, the known, appositive cues were fixated longer when they followed the pseudowords than when they preceded them; however, their presence did not lead to higher retention of the pseudowords.
We discuss how eye-tracking may add to existing methodologies for studying attention and noticing (Schmidt, 1990) in SLA. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	abstract = {Second language (L2) researchers are becoming more interested in both L2 learners' knowledge of the target language and how that knowledge is put to use during real-time language processing. Researchers are therefore beginning to see the importance of combining traditional L2 research methods with those that capture the moment-by-moment interpretation of the target language, such as eye-tracking. The major benefit of the eye-tracking method is that it can tap into real-time (or online) comprehension processes during the uninterrupted processing of the input, and thus, the data can be compared to those elicited by other, more metalinguistic tasks to offer a broader picture of language acquisition and processing. In this article, we present an overview of the eye-tracking technique and illustrate the method with L2 studies that show how eye-tracking data can be used to (a) investigate language-related topics and (b) inform key debates in the fields of L2 acquisition and L2 processing.

Emerging research is advancing the view that the capacity to acquire language can be applied equally to two languages as to one but that bilingual and monolingual acquisition nonetheless differ in some nontrivial ways. To probe the first steps toward acquisition, researchers recently have begun to use experimental methods to study preverbal bilingual infants. We review the literature in this growing field, focusing on how infants growing up bilingual use surface acoustic information to separate, categorize and begin to learn their two languages. These new data invite the expansion of standard linguistic theories to account for how a single architecture can support the acquisition of two languages simultaneously.},

Event-related potentials (ERPs) to words were examined in 19- to 22-month-old English-Spanish bilingual toddlers. The children's dominant vs. nondominant languages elicited different patterns of neural activity in the lateral asymmetry of an early positive component (P100), and the latencies and distributions of ERP differences to known vs. unknown words from 200–400 and 400–600 ms. ERP effects also differed for ‘high’ and ‘low’ vocabulary groups based on total conceptual vocabulary scores. The results indicate that the organization of language-relevant brain activity is linked to experience with language rather than brain maturation.},

We provide experimental evidence that this asymmetry is due to phonetic differences in the realisation of word-final [n] in English and French, and, consequently, to the way in which English and French word-final [n] are perceived by native speakers of Japanese. Specifically, French but not English word-final [n] has a strong vocalic release that Japanese listeners perceive as their native vowel [ui]. We propose a psycholinguistic model in which most loanword adaptations originate in perceptual assimilation, a process which takes place during perception and which maps non-native sounds and sound structures onto the phonetically closest native ones. We compare our model to alternatives couched within phonological theory.},

The evidence comes primarily from surveys, interviews, and laboratory studies.

This article uses data from domestic migrant-worker returnee narratives to explore the use of CS in storytelling. Domestic-worker returnees in Indonesia participated in sharing sessions in which they talked about the trauma they experienced while they worked overseas as domestic helpers. CS was widely used and, through a discourse analysis of selected excerpts, the article shows that CS is used for addressee specification and emotional alignment. The article concludes by considering how researchers may use the trauma narratives of repressed groups for social activism.

As slang emerged with local linguistic capital, the teens used slang to create social boundaries not only between teens and adults, but also between each other. The discursive salience of region implicitly indexed socio-economic status and proximity to African Americans as markers that teens drew on to authenticate themselves and others as slang speakers.},

However, the mechanisms that support this remarkable achievement remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that infants use language-control mechanisms to preferentially activate the currently heard language during listening. In a naturalistic eye-tracking procedure, bilingual infants were more accurate at recognizing objects labeled in same-language sentences (“Find the dog!”) than in switched-language sentences (“Find the chien!”). Measurements of infants’ pupil size over time indicated that this resulted from increased cognitive load during language switches. However, language switches did not always engender processing difficulties: the switch cost was reduced or eliminated when the switch was from the nondominant to the dominant language, and when it crossed a sentence boundary. Adults showed the same patterns of performance as infants, even though target words were simple and highly familiar. Our results provide striking evidence from infancy to adulthood that bilinguals monitor their languages for efficient comprehension. Everyday practice controlling two languages during listening is likely to explain previously observed bilingual cognitive advantages across the lifespan.},

Although the distribution patterns of /r/ remain the same as for the two previous studies in terms of stylistic, social, and phonological variables (word-final vs. preobstruent), there have been significant increases in the overall percentages by some 10 to 20 percent, and there are important differences in terms of the age distribution: the 2009 study suggests that lower-middle-class younger speakers use the [r]-less variant considerably less than older speakers, contrary to Labov’s original survey. In addition, although African American informants use less word-final /r/ than whites, especially in preobstruent position, they nevertheless follow the general pattern of stylistic and social differentiation according to the store, suggesting that African Americans are moving toward greater integration within the New York City speech community.},

This article reports the findings of parallel studies of variable subject presence in two closely related sign language varieties, Australian Sign Language (Auslan) and New Zealand Sign Language (NZSL). The studies expand upon research in American Sign Language (ASL) (Wulf, Dudis, Bayley, \& Lucas, 2002) that found subject pronouns with noninflecting verbs to be more frequently unexpressed than expressed. The ASL study reported that null subject use correlates with both social and linguistic factors, the strongest of which is referential congruence with an antecedent in a preceding clause. Findings from the Auslan and NZSL studies also indicated that chains of reference play a stronger role in subject presence than either morphological factors (e.g., verb type), or social factors of age, gender, ethnicity, and language background. Overall results are consistent with the view that this feature of syntactic variation may be better accounted for in terms of information structure than sociolinguistic effects.

In this study I compare data from Southern Brazil on the use of a gente in the 1970s and the 1990s. Quantitative analyses are conducted in terms of two methodological approaches: apparent-time and real-time studies. In the real-time analysis, two kinds of studies are discussed: a trend study, with two comparable groups of speakers, and a panel study, with the same speakers compared longitudinally. The linguistic and social embedding of this process is discussed in terms of the Labovian classification of changes as being "from above" or "from below." [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

There were no consistent patterns of gender or social class variation in their use, but a clear social class difference in the use of certain forms, with and that favoured by the working-class speakers and and stuff and and things preferred by the middle-class adolescents. The most frequent forms were analysed in terms of phonetic reduction, decategorisation, semantic change and pragmatic shift, changes that together make up the process of grammaticalisation. And that and and everything were the most grammaticalised, followed by or something, with and stuff and and things lagging behind. The multifunctionality of the general extenders caused problems for a rigorous analysis of their pragmatic functions. The paper argues that we must consider their functions within the local contexts in which they occur, to take account of their interaction with other linguistic forms. It is also important to avoid generalising about their functions and, instead, to prioritise the fact that as pragmatic particles they are multifunctional. In this data the general extenders had functions in every communicative domain, often simultaneously. The implications for the quantitative analysis of discourse forms are also considered.},

A methodologically coherent analysis reveals that the ‘classic factors’ ( Tagliamonte and D’Arcy 2007 : 203) grammatical person and content of the quote, as well as the effect of mimesis, are transferred to the receptor variety, albeit with varying degrees of completeness. Other conditioning factors are particularized to the local system into which be like is adopted, which leads us to define its spread as a case of weak transfer. We suggest that there are at least two explanations for this finding: (1) global innovations must be considered in light of the local systems into which they are adopted; and (2) the form and amount of contact must be correlated with respect to the knowledge transfer they allow.},

We focus on the production of the /ai/diphthong among adolescents in two emerging Hispanic communities, one in an urban and one in a rural context. Though both English and Spanish have the diphthong /ai/, the Southern regional variant of the benchmark local dialect norm is unglided, thus providing a local dialect alternative. The instrumental analysis of /ai/ shows that there is not pervasive accommodation to the local norm by Hispanic speakers learning English. There is, however, gradient, incremental adjustment of the /ai/, and individual speakers who adopt local cultural values may accommodate to the local dialect pattern.},

This study investigates how linguistic variation carries social meaning, examining the impact of the English variable (ING) on perceptions of eight speakers from the U.S. West Coast and South. Thirty-two excerpts of spontaneous speech were digitally manipulated to vary only in tokens of (ING) and used to collect listener perceptions in group interviews (N = 55) and an experiment (N = 124). Interview data and experimental results show that (ING) impacts social perception variably, inhabiting an indexical field of related meanings (Eckert, Penelope. [2008]. Variation and the indexical field. Journal of Sociolinguistics 12(4):453-476). One of these meanings, intelligence/education, is explored in detail to understand how a given meaning is realized or not in a specific context. Speakers were heard as less educated/intelligent when they used -in, but this effect is driven by reactions to speakers heard as aregional and not as working-class. Some implications on our future understanding of the processing of socially laden variation are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

The migration of old-urban elites to new-urban areas has been given scant attention in the sociolinguistics of mobility. This article examines language ideologies of differentiation that emerged from the migration of Morocco's bona fide old-urban elite from the city of Fez (the Fessis) to the new metropolis of Casablanca. This understudied sociolinguistic encounter brings into sharp focus two quintessential old-urban and new-urban varieties of Arabic along with their complex indexical system that links linguistic forms to identities, lifestyles, and moralities. Based on ethnography and discourse analysis of interviews with two women of Fessi extraction in Casablanca (a migrant and a local-born), I provide an in-depth account of what sounding Fessi means and accomplishes--and fails to accomplish--for these women, showing in the process the (re)production and change of language ideologies. The article demonstrates how changes in indexicalities relate to ongoing group boundary reconfiguration and to processes of linguistic (non)accommodation.

	abstract = {The ideological and indexical aspects of linguistic representation have been extensively examined in contemporary sociolinguistics both through investigations of language crossing in everyday interaction and through analyses of mediatized linguistic performances. Less well understood are the indexical meanings achieved when language crossing itself becomes the focus of linguistic representation. One prominent instance of this phenomenon is the use of African American English by European American actors in Hollywood films as part of what is argued to be a complex language-based form of blackface minstrelsy. As mock language, linguistic minstrelsy in such films involves sociolinguistic processes of deauthentication, maximizing of intertextual gaps, and indexical regimentation of the performed language, but unlike earlier forms of minstrelsy these performances are typically problematized within the films as transgressions of the ideology of racial essentialism. In the two films analyzed in detail in the article, linguistic minstrelsy is shown both to reproduce and to undermine the symbolic dominance of hegemonic white masculinity.},

Unfortunately, many teachers, however, are not prepared to meet the increasing need of the students’ population that they encounter in the classroom. One area in which teachers do not receive adequate training is language diversity. In particular, African American Vernacular English is often an unfamiliar language for many educators. This study employed a language attitude scale to assess the attitudes toward African American Vernacular English of preservice teachers in a multicultural, undergraduate education course. The findings revealed that European American students expressed a belief that African American Vernacular English is a negative and inferior dialect of English, while African American and Hispanic students expressed more favorable views of African American Vernacular English. The study suggests that pre-service teachers should receive training on the different dialects of English that students may speak in the classroom.},

No differences between native and non-native speakers in their behavioural responses were present: the pattern of interference from negative and taboo words was found to be identical in L1 and L2. SCLs, however, did reveal differences between the native and non-native participants: native English speakers responded with significantly higher SCLs to negative and taboo words when compared with neutral and positive words. This difference was not observed in non-native speakers, although there was a trend for taboo words to elicit greater SCLs than positive words. This suggests that, although the two groups responded in a very similar manner on a behavioural level, the level of arousal produced by the negative and taboo words for native English speakers was greater than that for non-native speakers.},

In the emotional Stroop task, which taps into an automatic early lexical level of processing, the bilingual participants did not display the same automatic level of activation in their second language (L2) as in their first language (L1). In the emotionality-rating task, which involves a later, more in-depth conscious level of processing than the preceding task, similar results were found in both languages spoken by the bilinguals. These findings are interpreted as indicating that late bilinguals do not automatically respond to the emotional arousal associated with the meanings of L2 words to the same extent as in the L1, and this is likely to be mediated by language proficiency and the context in which the language is learned.},

Investigating transfer in a situation of long-term societal language contact aims to shed light on the emergence of regional French phonological features from contact with Occitan. Using a sociophonetic methodology, the concept of equivalence classification (Flege 1988) is investigated, that is, that L2 words will be (initially) decomposed into familiar L2 sound categories, causing L1 and L2 sounds to resemble each other phonetically. The consequences of language contact are modelled statistically using an original corpus of over 1200 vowel tokens. The findings show that equivalence classification may not lead to equated sounds coming to resemble each other phonetically, suggesting necessary revisions to the speech learning model (SLM) hypothesis, and the need to consider the influence of sociolinguistic factors in situations of long-term language contact is emphasised.},

A close examination of participant roles shows that although these may appear to be predetermined by the interpretee-interpreter format of the sermon, speaking roles are actually fluid and negotiated. I submit that an important role of the church interpreter is to convey the pastor's inspiration from the Holy Spirit and reach out to the potential audience absent from the here and now of the service. His high emotional engagement helps convey this inspiration prospectively to the audience and retroactively to the pastor himself.},

	abstract = {If I Could Turn My Tongue Like That, by Thomas Klingler, is an in-depth study of the Creole language spoken in Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana, a community situated on the west bank of the Mississippi River above Baton Rouge that dates back to the early eighteenth century. The first comprehensive grammatical description of this particular variety of Louisiana Creole, Klingler's work is timely indeed, since most Creole speakers in the Pointe Coupee area are over sixty-five and the language is not being passed on to younger generations. It preserves and explains an important yet little understood part of America's cultural heritage that is rapidly disappearing.The heart of the book is a detailed morphosyntactic description based on some 150 hours of interviews with Pointe Coupee Creole speakers. Each grammatical feature is amply illustrated with contextual examples, and Klingler's descriptive framework will facilitate comparative research. The author also provides historical and sociolinguistic background information on the region, examining economic, demographic, and social conditions that contributed to the formation and spread of Creole in Louisiana. Pointe Coupee Creole is unusual, and in some cases unique, because of such factors as the parish's early exposure to English, its rapid development of a plantation economy, and its relative insulation from Cajun French.The volume concludes with transcriptions and English translations of Creole folk tales and of Klingler's conversations with Pointe Coupee's residents, a treasure trove of cultural and linguistic raw data. This kind of rarely printed material will be essential in preserving Creole in the future. Encylopedic in its approach and featuring a comprehensive bibliography, If I Could Turn My Tongue Like That is a rich resource for those interested in the development of Louisiana Creole and in Francophony.},

English listeners showed no such viewing time difference. The confusability was asymmetric: given pencil as target, panda did not distract more than distinct competitors. Distractors with Dutch names phonologically related to English target names (deksel, ‘lid,’ given target desk) also received longer fixations than distractors with phonologically unrelated names. Again, English listeners showed no differential effect. With the materials translated into Dutch, Dutch listeners showed no activation of the English words (desk, given target deksel). The results motivate two conclusions: native phonemic categories capture second-language input even when stored representations maintain a second-language distinction; and lexical competition is greater for non-native than for native listeners.},

	abstract = {Bilingualism provides a unique opportunity for exploring hypotheses about how the human brain encodes language. For example, the “input switch” theory states that bilinguals can deactivate one language module while using the other. A new measure of spoken language comprehension, headband-mounted eyetracking, allows a firm test of this theory. When given spoken instructions to pick up an object, in a monolingual session, late bilinguals looked briefly at a distractor object whose name in the irrelevant language was initially phonetically similar to the spoken word more often than they looked at a control distractor object. This result indicates some overlap between the two languages in bilinguals, and provides support for parallel, interactive accounts of spoken word recognition in general.},

into dialect regions, within the context of a single joint statistical model — thus simultaneously identifying
coherent dialect regions and the words that distinguish them.  Finally, a diachronic analysis reveals rapid

Listeners between 4 and 79 years old in the Midwestern United States heard talkers from the Midland, Northern, Southern, and New England regions in two regional dialect perception tasks: identification and discrimination. The results showed that listeners as young as 4–5 years old understand the identity-marking significance of some regional dialects, although adult-like performance was not achieved until adolescence. Further, the findings suggest that regional dialect perception is simultaneously impacted by the specific dialects involved and the cognitive difficulty of the task.},

Here we report on the emergence of a particular social convention on Twitter—the way to indicate a tweet is being reposted and to attribute the content to its source. Initially, different variations were invented and spread through the Twitter network. The inventors and early adopters were well-connected, active, core members of the Twitter community. The diffusion networks of these conventions were dense and highly clustered, so no single user was critical to the adoption of the conventions. Despite being invented at different times and having different adoption rates, only two variations came to be widely adopted. In this paper we describe this process in detail, highlighting insights and raising questions about how social conventions emerge.},

A network analysis of group structures revealed that (a) content and form of communication is normative, group norms defining communication patterns within groups, (b) conformity to group norms increases over time, communication outside the group is governed by different social norms. Results show that norms prescribing a particular use of technology are socially constructed over time at the level of locally defined groups and also show that the influence of these norms is limited to the boundaries of the group. It is concluded that the process of social construction is restrained by social identities that become salient over the course of interaction via CMC.

	abstract = {Vibrant online communities are in constant flux. As members join and depart, the interactional norms evolve, stimulating further changes to the membership and its social dynamics. Linguistic change --- in the sense of innovation that becomes accepted as the norm --- is essential to this dynamic process: it both facilitates individual expression and fosters the emergence of a collective identity. We propose a framework for tracking linguistic change as it happens and for understanding how specific users react to these evolving norms. By applying this framework to two large online communities we show that users follow a determined two-stage lifecycle with respect to their susceptibility to linguistic change: a linguistically innovative learning phase in which users adopt the language of the community followed by a conservative phase in which users stop changing and the evolving community norms pass them by. Building on this observation, we show how this framework can be used to detect, early in a user's career, how long she will stay active in the community. Thus, this work has practical significance for those who design and maintain online communities. It also yields new theoretical insights into the evolution of linguistic norms and the complex interplay between community-level and individual-level linguistic change.},

We explain this phenomenon by using an evolutionary framework. We present a dynamical system describing competition between language acquisition devices, which differ in the length of the learning period. There are two selective forces that play a role in determining the critical learning period: (i) having a longer learning period increases the accuracy of language acquisition; (ii) learning is associated with certain costs that affect fitness. As a result, there exists a limited learning period which is evolutionarily stable. This result is obtained analytically by means of a Nash equilibrium analysis of language acquisition devices. Interestingly, the evolutionarily stable learning period does not maximize the average fitness of the population.},

We use agent-based computer simulations to investigate the dynamic properties of these network roles in a large social influence network, in which diffusion is modeled as the probabilistic uptake of one of several competing variants by agents of unequal social standing. We find that highly-connected agents, structural equivalents of leaders in empirical studies, advance on-going change by spreading competing variants. Isolated agents, or loners, holding on to existing variants are safe-keepers of variants considered old or new depending on the current state of the rest of the population. Innovations spread following a variety of S-curves and stabilize as norms in the network only if two conditions are simultaneously satisfied: (1) the network comprises extremely highly connected and very isolated agents, and (2) agents are biased to pay proportionally more attention to better connected, or popular, neighbors. These findings reconcile competing models of individual network roles in the selection and propagation process of language change, and support Bloomfield's hypothesis that the spread of linguistic innovations in heterogeneous social networks depend upon communication density and relative prestige.},

It is increasingly common in the sociolinguistic literature for researchers to utilize speech data that was collected over the course of many decades. These kinds of datasets contain three different time dimensions that researchers can utilize to investigate language change: (i) the speakers’ dates of birth, (ii) the speakers’ ages at the time of the recording, and (iii) the date of the recording. Proper investigation of all three time dimensions is crucial for a theoretical understanding of the dynamics of language change. I recommend utilizing two-dimensional tensor product smooths, fit over speakers’ date of birth and the year of the recording, to analyze the contribution of these three time dimensions to linguistic changes. I apply this method to five language changes, based on data drawn from the Philadelphia Neighborhood Corpus. I find relatively weak evidence for lifespan effects in these changes, robust generational effects, and in one case, evidence of a zeitgeist effect.},

	abstract = {In this study, we investigate syntactic and prosodic features of the speaker's speech at points where turn-taking and backchannels occur, on the basis of our analysis of Japanese spontaneous dialogs. Specifically, we focus on features such as part of speech, duration, F0 contour pattern, relative height of the peak F0, energy trajectory pattern, and relative height of the peak energy at the final part of speech segments. We examine, first, the relationship between turn-taking/backchannels and each feature of speech segments independently, showing that the features examined in this study are all related to turn-taking or backchannels and that the way they correlate is fairly consistent with previous studies. Next, we explore the inter-relationship among the features with respect to turn-taking and backchannels. We show that in both turn-taking and backchannels, (I) some instances of syntactic features make extremely strong contributions, and (2) in general, syntax has a stronger contribution than any individual prosodic feature, although the whole prosody contributes as strongly as, or even more strongly than, syntax. We also discuss some implications of our results, comparing them with previous models that have mentioned roles of syntax and prosody in turn-taking and backchannels.},

We present a variationist study of /θ/ and /ð/ in the speech of bilingual Cajuns in St. Landry Parish. The results show a complex interrelationship of age, gender, and social network. One of the major findings is a v-shaped age pattern rather than the regular generational model that is expected. The older generation use more of the dental variants [t, d] than all others, the middle-aged dramatically decrease their use, but the young show a level of usage closer to the old generation. The change is attributed to both language attrition and the blossoming of the Cajun cultural renaissance. Interestingly, neither young men in open networks nor women of all ages in open networks follow the v-shaped age pattern. In addition, they show opposite directions of change: men in open networks lead the change to [d], whereas women in open networks drop the dental variants of [t, d] almost entirely.},

Using the theoretical framework of ethnolinguistic vitality, it was hypothesized that the experience of the linguistic landscape by members of a language group may contribute to social psychological aspects of bilingual development. Factor analysis results show that the linguistic landscape emerges as a distinct factor separate from other measures of linguistic contacts. This factor was an important correlate of subjective ethnolinguistic vitality representing perceptions of the vitality of the in-group language in various domains. The study also found relations between the Linguistic Landscape factor and degree of in-group language use, especially in institutional settings, suggesting a 'carryover effect" of the linguistic landscape on language behavior.},

	abstract = {Variation across talkers in the acoustic-phonetic realization of speech sounds is a pervasive property of spoken language. The present study provides evidence that variation across talkers in the realization of American English stop consonants is highly structured. Positive voice onset time (VOT) was examined for all six word-initial stop categories in isolated productions of CVC syllables and in a multi-talker corpus of connected read speech. The mean VOT for each stop differed considerably across talkers, replicating previous findings, but importantly there were strong and statistically significant linear relations among the means (e.g., the mean VOTs of [pʰ] and [kʰ] were highly correlated across talkers, r{\textgreater}0.80). The pattern of VOT covariation was not reducible to differences in speaking rate or other factors known to affect the realization of stop consonants. These findings support a uniformity constraint on the talker-specific realization of a phonetic property, such as glottal spreading, that is shared by multiple speech sounds. Because uniformity implies mutual predictability, the findings also shed light on listeners׳ ability to generalize knowledge of a novel talker from one stop consonant to another. More broadly, structured variation of the kind investigated here indicates a relatively low-dimensional encoding of talker-specific phonetic realization in both speech production and speech perception.},

	abstract = {Southern Louisiana is the only effective remnant of the French presence in the Mississippi River valley during the lBth century.
During the colonial period, settled French Louisiana was a small
neglected parcel of the vast French North American empire. Later,
under the Spanish, it was seen as little more than a shield for New
Spain against Anglo-American encroachement.
Despite political Americanization in the early 19th century, rural
French Louisiana continued to grow as a distinctively French region.
In response to Anglo penetration, new environments were occupied and
mastered. ■' By 1900, southern Louisiana was a lively and discrete
culture region within the United states. It was, however,
compartmentalized, reflecting ethnic diversity within the French
population, diversity in physical geography, and class-based social
differentiation. A Louisiana-wide French consciousness had not been
achieved.
The 20th century brought better roads, radio, war, television,
industrialization, and more Anglos, leading to rapid cultural change.
Field work done in 1981 and 1982 examined changes in French Louisiana
culture in light of three major traditional markers: Catholic
religion, French language and food. It monitored the changing
geography of the region in terms of boundaries, internal cultural
change, and identity. The work attempts to establish whether these
changes suggest continuity, extinction, or some new form of ethnicity.
Analysis reveals that geographically, French Louisiana has begun
to Bhrink. Areas within the region have been changing at different
rates, however. The French language is Btill being eroded despite
efforts at revival. Religious indifference persists\vphantom{\{}\} the Catholic
Church does not function as an ethnic institution. The food, however,
remained very popular and has become the unifying element of the
culture region.
French Louisiana now uses ethnic politics and outside approval of
ethnicity to maintain itself: it has a state-recognized "official
territory" and a cultural capital, Lafayette. The Cajun identity has
been beautified and promoted as the new regional identity (but excludes
the non-white French population). The food, a national fad, has
replaced language as the most important element of the French Louisiana
culture. These changes suggest that traditional French Louisiana is
entering the American cultural mainstream.},

Trilinguals with Dutch as their native and dominant language (L1), English as their second language (L2), and French as their third language (L3) performed a word association task (Experiment 1) or a lexical decision task (Experiments 2 and 3) in L1. The L1 stimulus words were cognates with their translations in English, cognates with their translations in French, or were noncognates. In Experiments 1 and 2 with trilinguals who were highly proficient in English and relatively low in proficiency in French, we observed shorter word association and lexical decision times to the L1 words that were cognates with English than to the noncognates. In these relatively low-proficiency French speakers, response times (RTs) for the L1 words that were cognates with French did not differ from those for the noncognates. In Experiment 3, we tested Dutch-English- French trilinguals with a higher level of fluency in French (i.e., equally fluent in English and in French). We now observed faster responses on the L1 words that were cognates with French than on the noncognates. Lexical decision times to the cognates with English were also shorter than those to the noncognates. The results indicate that words presented in the dominant language, to naive participants, activate information in the nontarget, and weaker, language in parallel, implying that the multilinguals’ processing system is profoundly nonselective with respect to language. A minimal level of nontarget language fluency seems to be required, however, before any weaker language effects become noticeable in L1 processing.},

Cognate naming latencies were influenced by the cross-language match of the orthographic and phonological codes. When the orthographic forms were similar in the two languages, naming latencies were slowed by dissimilar phonology, providing evidence for feed-forward activation from orthography to phonology across languages. When the orthographic forms were dissimilar, the effects of the corresponding phonological match were not statistically reliable. The results suggest that lexical access is non-selective across bilinguals' two languages, and that the degree of consistency between orthographic and phonological codes influences the manner in which cross-language competition is manifest.

One piece of evidence is that bilinguals recognise cognates (words that are identical or similar in form and meaning in two languages) faster than non-cognates. The present study used cognates to investigate whether the non-selective access hypothesis holds also for trilinguals and three languages. Dutch-English-German trilinguals carried out a lexical decision task in their third language (German). The word materials included purely German control words, “double” cognates that overlapped in Dutch and German, but not in English, and “triple” cognates with the same form and meaning in Dutch, German, and English. Faster RTs were found for Dutch-German cognates than for control words, but additionally, “triple” cognates were processed even faster than “double” cognates. The “triple” cognate effect was not influenced by whether the participants had previously read an English text. A control experiment with German monolinguals confirmed that the effect was not an artifact of uncontrolled stimulus characteristics. Thus, independent of context, both the native language and another foreign non-target language influenced target language comprehension in trilinguals. This supports a view of language non-selective access implying all languages known to an individual may affect word activation and recognition.},

In the generalized Experiment 3, participants reacted equally quickly on Dutch-English homographs and Dutch control words, indicating that their response was based primarily on the fastest available orthographic code (i.e., Dutch). In Experiment 4, cognates were recognized faster than English and Dutch controls, suggesting coactivation of the cognates’ semantics.

If nonselected lexical nodes are phonologically encoded, naming latencies should be shorter for cognate words, and because the cognate status of words is only meaningful for bilingual speakers, this difference should disappear when testing monolingual speakers. The results of Experiment 1 fully supported these predictions. In Experiment 2, the difference between cognate and noncognate words was larger when naming in the nondominant language than when naming in the dominant language. The results of the 2 experiments are interpreted as providing support to cascaded activation models of lexical access. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

This study focused on how knowledge of a second language influences how people read sentences written in their native language. We used the cognate-facilitation effect as a marker of cross-lingual activations in both languages. Cognates (e.g., Dutch-English schip [ship]) and controls were presented in a sentence context, and eye movements were monitored. Results showed faster reading times for cognates than for controls. Thus, this study shows that one of people's most automated skills, reading in one's native language, is changed by the knowledge of a second language.},

After pointing out problems and omissions, a new model, called the BIA+, is proposed. Structurally, this new model extends the old one by adding phonological and semantic lexical representations to the available orthographic ones, and assigns a different role to the so-called language nodes. Furthermore, it makes a distinction between the effects of non-linguistic context (such as instruction and stimulus list composition) and linguistic context (such as the semantic and syntactic effects of sentence context), based on a distinction between the word identification system itself and a task/decision system that regulates control. At the end of the paper, the generalizability of the BIA+ model to different tasks and modalities is discussed.},

Shortly after encountering the homograph, the groups showed equivalent implausibility effects when its English meaning was incongruent with the preceding sentence context. No evidence for immediate homograph interference emerged during this period in the bilingual group. Only in later processing measures did group and congruency interact. Bilinguals may have initially accessed and selected the language appropriate meaning of the homograph to integrate into the sentence. Later, bilinguals accessed their first language lexicon and integrated the Spanish meaning into the sentence when semantically appropriate. Rather than always experiencing cross-language competition, proficient bilinguals may dynamically adapt to contextual cues and selectively access information associated with the contextually cued language under certain conditions.},

We now investigate whether cross-language activation also occurs during first language (L1) reading as a function of age of L2 acquisition and task demands (i.e., inclusion of L2 sentences). In Experiment 1, participants read high and low constraint English (L1) sentences containing interlingual homographs, cognates, or control words. In Experiment 2, we included French (L2) filler sentences to increase salience of the L2 during L1 reading. The results suggest that bilinguals reading in their L1 show nonselective activation to the extent that they acquired their L2 early in life. Similar to our previous work on L2 reading, high contextual constraint attenuated cross-language activation for cognates. The inclusion of French filler items promoted greater cross-language activation, especially for late stage reading measures. Thus, L1 bilingual reading is modulated by L2 knowledge, semantic constraint, and task demands. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

In Experiment 1, subjects’ eye movements were monitored while they read English sentences in which sentence constraint, word frequency, and language of target word were manipulated. A frequency × constraint interaction was found when target words appeared in Spanish, but not in English. First fixation durations were longer for high-frequency Spanish words when these were embedded in high-constraint sentences than in low-constraint sentences. This result suggests that the conceptual restrictions produced by the sentence context were met, but that the lexical restrictions were not. The same result did not occur for low-frequency Spanish words, presumably because the slower access of low-frequency words provided more processing time for the resolution of this conflict. Similar results were found in Experiment 2 using rapid serial visual presentation when subjects named the target words aloud. It appears that sentence context effects are influenced by both semantic/conceptual and lexical information.},

The results showed that bilinguals displayed larger L2 than L1 FEs during both early- and late-stage eye movement measures, which are taken to reflect initial lexical access and postlexical access, respectively. Moreover, the magnitude of L2 FEs was inversely related to current L2 exposure, such that lower levels of L2 exposure led to larger L2 FEs. In contrast, during early-stage reading measures, bilinguals with higher levels of current L2 exposure showed larger L1 FEs than did bilinguals with lower levels of L2 exposure, suggesting that increased L2 experience modifies the earliest stages of L1 lexical access. Taken together, the findings are consistent with implicit learning accounts (e.g., Monsell, 1991), the weaker links hypothesis (Gollan, Montoya, Cera, Sandoval, Journal of Memory and Language, 58:787–814, 2008), and current bilingual visual word recognition models (e.g., the bilingual interactive activation model plus [BIA+]; Dijkstra \& van Heuven, Bilingualism: Language and Cognition, 5:175–197, 2002). Thus, amount of current L2 exposure is a key determinant of FEs and, thus, lexical activation, in both the L1 and L2.},

We thus investigated whether individual differences among bilinguals in domain-general executive control modulate cross-language activation during L2 sentence reading, over and above other factors such as L2 proficiency. Fifty French–English bilinguals read L2-English sentences while their eye movements were recorded, and they subsequently completed a battery of executive control and L2 proficiency tasks. High- and low-constraint sentences contained interlingual homographs (chat = 'casual conversation' in English, 'a cat' in French), cognates (piano in English and French), or L2-specific control words. The results showed that greater executive control among bilinguals but not L2 proficiency reduced cross-language activation in terms of interlingual homograph interference. In contrast, increased L2 proficiency but not executive control reduced cross-language activation in terms of cognate facilitation. These results suggest that models of bilingual reading must incorporate mechanisms by which domain-general executive control can alter the earliest stages of bilingual lexical activation.

Recently, an extreme form of multiple activation was observed: Bilingual listeners activated words from both languages that were consistent with the input. We explored the degree to which bilingual multiple activation may be constrained by fine-grained acoustic-phonetic information. In a head-mounted eyetracking experiment, we presented Spanish-English bilinguals with spoken Spanish words having word-initial stop consonants with either English- or Spanish-appropriate voice onset times. Participants fixated interlingual distractors (nontarget pictures whose English names shared a phonological similarity with the Spanish targets) more frequently than control distractors when the target words contained English-appropriate voice onset times. These results demonstrate that fine-grained acoustic-phonetic information and a precise match between input and representation are critical for parallel activation of two languages.},

A series of three eyetracking studies suggested that, at early stages of word recognition, bilinguals can activate both languages in parallel, even when direct linguistic input is in one language only. A functional neuroimaging study suggested that, although the same general structures are active for both languages, differences within these general structures are present across languages and across levels of processing. For example, different centers of activation were associated with first versus second language processing within the left Inferior Frontal Gyrus, but not within the Superior Temporal Gyrus. We suggest that parallel activation (as found with eyetracking) and shared cortical structures (as found with fMRI) may be characteristic of early stages of language processing (such as phonetic processing), but the two languages may be using separate structures at later stages of processing (such as lexical processing).},

	abstract = {Current models of bilingualism (e.g., BIA+) posit that lexical access during reading is not language selective. However, much of this research is based on the comprehension of words in isolation. The authors investigated whether nonselective access occurs for words embedded in biased sentence contexts (e.g., A. I. Schwartz \& J. F. Kroll, 2006). Eye movements were recorded as French–English bilinguals read English sentences containing cognates (e.g., piano), interlingual homographs (e.g., coin, meaning corner in French), or matched control words. Sentences provided a low or high semantic constraint for target-language meanings. Both early-stage comprehension measures (e.g., first fixation duration, gaze duration, and skipping) and late-stage comprehension measures (e.g., go-past time and total reading time) showed significant cognate facilitation and interlingual homograph interference for low-constraint sentences. For high-constraint sentences, however, only early-stage comprehension measures were consistent with nonselective access. There was no evidence of cognate facilitation or interlingual homograph interference for late-stage comprehension measures. Thus, nonselective bilingual lexical access at early stages of comprehension is rapidly resolved in semantically biased contexts at later stages of comprehension.

	abstract = {Psycholinguistics—the field of science that examines the mental processes and knowledge structures involved in the acquisition, comprehension, and production of language—had a strong monolingual orientation during (he first four decades following its emergence around 1950. The awareness that a large part of mankind speaks more than one language—that this may impact both on the way each individual language is used and on the thought processes of bilinguals and multilinguals, and that, consequently, our theories on human linguistic ability and its role in non-linguistic cognition are incomplete and, perhaps, false—has led to a steep growth of studies on bilingualism and multilingualism since around 1995. This textbook introduces the reader to the field of study that examines language acquisition, comprehension and production from the perspective of the bilingual and multilingual speaker. It furthermore provides an introduction to studies that investigate the implications of being bilingual for various aspects of non-linguistic cognition. The major topics covered are the development of language in children growing up in a bilingual environment either from birth or relatively soon after, late foreign language learning, and word recognition, sentence comprehension, speech production, and translation processes in bilinguals. Furthermore, the ability of bilinguals and multilinguals to generally produce language in the 'intended' language is discussed, as is the cognitive machinery that enables this. Finally, the consequences of bilingualism and multilingualism for non-linguistic cognition and findings and views regarding the biological basis of bilingualism and multilingualism are presented. The textbook's primary readership are students and researchers in Cognitive Psychology, Linguistics, and Applied Linguistics, but teachers of language and translators and interpreters who wish to become better informed on the cognitive and biological basis of bilingualism and multilingualism will also benefit from it.

We extend the work of Gunraj, Drumm-Hewitt, Dashow, Upadhyay, and Klin (2016) who found that the inclusion of a period after a positive one-word response (e.g., yeah.) led readers to perceive the response as less sincere. In Experiment 1, we used longer text exchanges that were more naturalistic and replicated this finding. In Experiments 2 and 3, negative responses (e.g., nope) and ambiguous responses (e.g., maybe) were also perceived as more negative, or less enthusiastic, with a period. The period can serve a rhetorical, rather than a grammatical, function in text messages. More generally, textisms such as punctuation can convey the types of social and pragmatic information that are communicated with extra-linguistic cues in face-to-face conversations.},

	abstract = {Southern Louisiana is the only effective remnant of the French presence in the Mississippi River valley during the 18th century. During the colonial period, settled French Louisiana was a small neglected parcel of the vast French North American empire. Later, under the Spanish, it was seen as little more than a shield for New Spain against Anglo-American encroachement.
Despite political Americanization in the early 19th century, rural French Louisiana continued to grow as a distinctively French region. In response to Anglo penetration, new environments were occupied and mastered. By 1900, southern Louisiana was a lively and discrete culture region within the United States. It was, however, compartmentalized, reflecting ethnic diversity within the French population, diversity in physical geography, and class-based social differentiation. A Louisiana-wide French consciousness had not been achieved.
The 20th century brought better roads, radio, war, television, industrialization, and more Anglos, leading to rapid cultural change. Field work done in 1981 and 1982 examined changes in French Louisiana culture in light of three major traditional markers: Catholic religion, French language and food. It monitored the changing geography of the region in terms of boundaries, internal cultural change, and identity. The work attempts to establish whether these changes suggest continuity, extinction, or some new form of ethnicity.
Analysis reveals that geographically, French Louisiana has begun to shrink. Areas within the region have been changing at different rates, however. The French language is still being eroded despite efforts at revival. Religious indifference persists; the Catholic Church does not function as an ethnic institution. The food, however, remained very popular and has become the unifying element of the culture region.
French Louisiana now uses ethnic politics and outside approval of ethnicity to maintain itself: it has a state-recognized "official territory" and a cultural capital, Lafayette. The Cajun identity has been beautified and promoted as the new regional identity (but excludes the non-white French population). The food, a national fad, has replaced language as the most important element of the French Louisiana culture. These changes suggest that traditional French Louisiana is entering the American cultural mainstream.},

	abstract = {The precision of an eye-tracker is critical to the correct identification of eye movements and their properties. To measure a system’s precision, artificial eyes (AEs) are often used, to exclude eye movements influencing the measurements. A possible issue, however, is that it is virtually impossible to construct AEs with sufficient complexity to fully represent the human eye. To examine the consequences of this limitation, we tested currently used AEs from three manufacturers of eye-trackers and compared them to a more complex model, using 12 commercial eye-trackers. Because precision can be measured in various ways, we compared different metrics in the spatial domain and analyzed the power-spectral densities in the frequency domain. To assess how precision measurements compare in artificial and human eyes, we also measured precision using human recordings on the same eye-trackers. Our results show that the modified eye model presented can cope with all eye-trackers tested and acts as a promising candidate for further development of a set of AEs with varying pupil size and pupil–iris contrast. The spectral analysis of both the AE and human data revealed that human eye data have different frequencies that likely reflect the physiological characteristics of human eye movements. We also report the effects of sample selection methods for precision calculations. This study is part of the EMRA/COGAIN Eye Data Quality Standardization Project.},

	abstract = {Bilinguals, i.e. those who use two languages in their everyday lives, move in and out of various speech modes when speaking to different interlocutors. When conversing with monolinguals, they speak one language and reduce the activation level of the other language, but when conversing with other bilinguals they choose a base language of interaction and often bring in the other language by either code-switching or borrowing. The aim of the present study is to explore how “guest words” (code-switches and borrowings) are processed by bilingual listeners when interacting with other bilinguals. Different types of English words (varying in phonotactic configuration and lexicon membership) were embedded in French sentences and were produced either as code-switches or borrowings. The gating paradigm (Grosjean, 1980) was used to present these words to French-English bilingual listeners so as to determine the role played by word type and language phonetics in the lexical access of guest words, as well as to uncover the underlying operations involved in the recognition process. Results showed that the phonotactics of a guest word, the presence or absence of a base language homophone, the language phonetics of the word, as well as the language that precedes the word, all play a role in the recognition process. An interactive activation view of bilingual word recognition is proposed to account for the results found in the study.},

The distractor objects included a cohort competitor with a name that began with the same onset and vowel as the name of the target object (e.g.,beetle), a rhyme competitor (e.g.speaker), and an unrelated competitor (e.g.,carriage). In Experiment 1, there was clear evidence for both cohort and rhyme activation as predicted by continuous mapping models such as TRACE (McClelland and Elman, 1986) and Shortlist (Norris, 1994). Additionally, the time course and probabilities of eye movements closely corresponded to response probabilities derived from TRACE simulations using the Luce choice rule (Luce, 1959). In the gating task, which emphasizes word-initial information, there was clear evidence for multiple activation of cohort members, as measured by judgments and eye movements, but no suggestion of rhyme effects. Given that the same sets of pictures were present during the gating task as in Experiment 1, we conclude that the rhyme effects in Experiment 1 were not an artifact of using a small set of visible alternatives.},

	abstract = {We describe a model called the TRACE model of speech perception. The model is based on the principles of interactive activation. Information processing takes place through the excitatory and inhibitory interactions of a large number of simple processing units, each working continuously to update its own activation on the basis of the activations of other units to which it is connected. The model is called the TRACE model because the network of units forms a dynamic processing structure called “the Trace,” which serves at once as the perceptual processing mechanism and as the system's working memory. The model is instantiated in two simulation programs. TRACE I, described in detail elsewhere, deals with short segments of real speech, and suggests a mechanism for coping with the fact that the cues to the identity of phonemes vary as a function of context. TRACE II, the focus of this article, simulates a large number of empirical findings on the perception of phonemes and words and on the interactions of phoneme and word perception. At the phoneme level, TRACE II simulates the influence of lexical information on the identification of phonemes and accounts for the fact that lexical effects are found under certain conditions but not others. The model also shows how knowledge of phonological constraints can be embodied in particular lexical items but can still be used to influence processing of novel, nonword utterances. The model also exhibits categorical perception and the ability to trade cues off against each other in phoneme identification. At the word level, the model captures the major positive feature of Marslen-Wilson's COHORT model of speech perception, in that it shows immediate sensitivity to information favoring one word or set of words over others. At the same time, it overcomes a difficulty with the COHORT model: it can recover from underspecification or mispronunciation of a word's beginning. TRACE II also uses lexical information to segment a stream of speech into a sequence of words and to find word beginnings and endings, and it simulates a number of recent findings related to these points. The TRACE model has some limitations, but we believe it is a step toward a psychologically and computationally adequate model of the process of speech perception.},

	abstract = {This volume presents a selection of the best papers from the 21st Annual University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Linguistics Symposium. Researchers from linguistics, psychology, computer science, and philosophy, using many different methods and focusing on many different facts of language, addressed the question of the existence of linguistic rules. Are such rules best seen as convenient tools for the description of languages, or are rules actually invoked by individual language users? Perhaps the most serious challenge to date to the linguistic rule is the development of connectionist architecture. Indeed, these systems must be viewed as a serious challenge to the foundations of all of contemporary linguistics. Four broad themes emerged from the Milwaukee conference, corresponding to the four parts of the volume. Part I centers on arguments for the existence of symbolic rules in linguistic competence and performance. Part II contains arguments against symbolic rules, presenting connectionist models and other alternatives to the symbolic paradigm. Parts III and IV take up two issues that are central to a number of language researchers: Language acquisition and learnability, and modularity. These issues are addressed from within both rule-based and non-rule-based perspectives.

If monophthongization is the trigger for the Southern Shift (Labov, 2010) and chain shifts operate as predicted by a modular feedforward phonological theory (cf. Bermúdez-Otero, 2007), this implies price and prize must be two ends of a phonetic continuum, rather than two discrete allophones. We test this hypothesis via distributional analysis of offglide targets and statistical analysis of the effect of vowel duration. As predicted, we find price and prize share a continuous distribution in the Inland South, the region where the Southern Shift probably originated (Labov, Ash, \& Boberg, 2006). We use Raleigh, North Carolina, outside the Inland South, as a comparison point; there, the same methodologies indicate price and prize are more discretely separated. Our results thus offer empirical support for the phonological theory that motivated the hypothesis.},

Such research focused on the knowledge about language that the student teachers possessed when they moved from secondary school education into Initial Teacher Education (ITE) programmes. However, few studies have investigated the impact of the increasing demands on teachers, made in curricular documents throughout the last 20 years, to improve students’ abilities in language and whether student teachers’ knowledge about language had improved as a result of these curricular imperatives. This article reports on research into perceived and actual levels of knowledge about language conducted in a university in Scotland with students training to be primary teachers and secondary English and modern language teachers. Findings reveal that student teachers’ levels of linguistic knowledge, as measured by the instrument employed in this study, are generally low contrasting with their own more positive perceptions of their competence.},

In half of the experiment, the stimuli are presented orally only, whereas in the other half, the oral stimuli are accompanied by their written representation. The adaptations of eight English vowels are shown to be different according to whether the input is oral or mixed (i.e. oral+written). In particular, the adaptations based on the mixed input more often reflect the way French speakers are used to read English graphemes. These results thus confirm the sensitivity of loanword adaptations to the presence versus absence of a written representation.

Evidence is now mounting that orthographic effects on loanword adaptation may be more prevalent than was once thought (cf. Paradis and LaCharité, 2002, Vendelin and Peperkamp, 2006), partially obscuring phonological effects. This paper investigates orthographic effects in the adaptation of vowels of English words loaned into Korean. Experiment I uses information-theoretic statistics, called the orthographic and perceptual information gains, to estimate a lower bound on the contribution of orthography and perception to vowel adaptation. The results suggest that orthography contributes more to the adaptation of unstressed vowels, while perception contributes more to the adaptation of stressed vowels. Experiment II considers the adaptation of the /ɛ/∼/æ/ contrast; these vowels have merged recently in Korean although the orthographic distinction is maintained. The paper concludes by proposing the Perceptual Uncertainty Hypothesis: source-loan orthographic alignment plays the greatest role in constraining loanword adaptation when phonological parsing in the borrowing language is underdetermined by perceptual factors alone.},

Dining Services decided on this name during the development of the dining hall on UGA’s Health Sciences Campus which focused on serving residents, students, and faculty/staff of that campus. Since that dining hall is smaller and a bit more unique than what is found on main campus, the department wanted students to feel as though they had found a special place or a place where they felt comfortable on campus. The Niche is a bit set apart from UGA’s other dining halls. When the Niche originally opened, it had a very specialized menu. It served grill, market, pizza, and gelato options that were not offered at the other dining halls. The department chose this name, therefore, to also reflect the location’s specialized menu and atmosphere.
 
Let me know if you have any more questions.

The circumstances of a recording are known to affect formant tracking and may therefore compromise the validity of conclusions about sound changes made on the basis of real-time data. In this paper, a traditional F1/F2-analysis using linear predictive coding (LPC) was applied to the vowels /i u a/ extracted from spontaneous speech corpora of Glaswegian vernacular, that were recorded in the 1970s and 2000s. We assessed the technical quality of each recording, concentrating on the average levels of noise and the properties of spectral balance, and showed that the corpus comprised of mixed quality data. A series of acoustic vowel analyses subsequently unveiled that formant measurements using LPC were sensitive to the technical specification of a recording, with variable magnitudes of the effects for vowels of different qualities. We evaluated the performance of three commonly used formant normalisation procedures (Lobanov, Nearey and Watt-Fabricius) as well as normalisations by a distance ratio metric and statistical estimation, and compared these results to raw Bark-scaled formant data, showing that some of the approaches could ameliorate the impact of technical issues better than the others. We discuss the implications of these results for sociophonetic research that aims to minimise extraneous influences on recorded speech data while unveiling gradual, potentially small-scale sound changes across decades.},

	abstract = {We present “Transcriber”, a tool for assisting in the creation of speech corpora, and describe some aspects of its development and use. Transcriber was designed for the manual segmentation and transcription of long duration broadcast news recordings, including annotation of speech turns, topics and acoustic conditions. It is highly portable, relying on the scripting language Tcl/Tk with extensions such as Snack for advanced audio functions and tcLex for lexical analysis, and has been tested on various Unix systems and Windows. The data format follows the XML standard with Unicode support for multilingual transcriptions. Distributed as free software in order to encourage the production of corpora, ease their sharing, increase user feedback and motivate software contributions, Transcriber has been in use for over a year in several countries. As a result of this collective experience, new requirements arose to support additional data formats, video control, and a better management of conversational speech. Using the annotation graphs framework recently formalized, adaptation of the tool towards new tasks and support of different data formats will become easier.
Résumé
Nous présentons “Transcriber”, un outil d'aide à la création de corpus de parole, et nous décrivons des éléments de son développement et de son utilisation. Transcriber a été conçu pour permettre la segmentation manuelle et la transcription d'enregistrements de nouvelles radio-diffusées de longue durée, ainsi que l'annotation des tours de parole, des thèmes et des conditions acoustiques. Cet outil très portable, reposant sur le langage de script Tcl/Tk et des extensions telles que Snack pour les fonctionnalités audio et tcLex pour l'analyse lexicale, a été testé sur différents systèmes Unix et sous Windows. Le format de données respecte le standard XML avec un support d'Unicode pour les transcriptions multilingues. Distribué sous license libre pour encourager la production de corpus, faciliter leur échange, augmenter le retour d'expérience des utilisateurs et motiver les contributions logicielles extérieures, Transcriber est utilisé depuis plus d'un an dans plusieurs pays. Suite à cette utilisation, de nouveaux besoins sont apparus comme le support de formats de données supplémentaires, de la vidéo, et un meilleur traitement de la parole conversationnelle. En utilisant le modèle des graphes d'annotation formalisé récemment, l'adaptation de l'outil vers de nouvelles tâches et le support de différents formats de données sera facilité.},

	abstract = {Evidence suggests that speakers hyperarticulate phonetic cues to word identity in a way that increases phonetic distance to similar competitors. However, the degree and type of phonetic similarity between competitors which induces hyperarticulation remains unclear. Here, we compared neighborhood density (as a representative of a phonetically-general type of similarity) to the existence of a phonetic cue-specific lexical minimal pair in terms of their ability to predict hyperarticulation of two different cue-types in a corpus of natural English speech. For all phonetic cues that we investigated – word-initial voiceless stop VOT, word-initial voiced stop VOT, and vowel-vowel Euclidean formant distance – cue-specific minimal pair existence significantly predicted cue hyperarticulation, while neighborhood density did not. Further, the direction of change in a phonetic cue was found not to be consistent within a given cue-type, but instead varied as a function of the phonetic relationship, creating greater phonetic distance to the competitor. For tokens of word-initial voiceless stops, existence of a voiced-stop minimal pair predicted significantly longer VOT, while for word-initial voiced stops, existence of a voiceless-stop minimal pair predicted a shorter VOT. For tokens of vowels, existence of a minimal pair defined by a nearby vowel predicted greater Euclidean distance in formant space from that vowel, rather than greater expansion of the vowel space per se. For example, lax vowels in words with a more peripheral vowel minimal pair competitor (e.g., ship ∼ sheep) were relatively centralized, while tense vowels in words with a more interior vowel minimal pair competitor (e.g., date ∼ debt) were relatively peripheralized.},

Within-language lexical competitors had a phoneme onset in English that was shared with the target (e.g., ‘beetle’). Between-language lexical competitors had a phoneme onset in Spanish that was shared with the target (‘ bi gote’, ‘mustache’ in English). Participant groups varied in their age-of-acquisition of English and Spanish, and were examined in one of three language modes (Grosjean, 1998, 2001). A strong within-language (English) lexical competition (or cohort effect) was modulated by language mode and age of second language acquisition. A weaker between-language (Spanish) cohort effect was influenced primarily by the age-of-acquisition of Spanish. These results highlight the role of age-of-acquisition and mode in language processing. They are discussed in comparison to previous studies addressing the role of these two variables and in terms of existing models of bilingual word recognition.},

Adult native speakers of languages with grammatical gender exploit this cue in on-line sentence interpretation. In a study investigating the early development of this ability, Spanish-learning children (34–42 months) were tested in an eye-tracking procedure. Presented with pairs of pictures with names of either the same grammatical gender (la pelota, “ball [feminine]”; la galleta, “cookie [feminine]”) or different grammatical gender (la pelota; el zapato, “shoe [masculine]”), they heard sentences referring to one picture (Encuentra la pelota, “Find the ball”). The children were faster to orient to the referent on different-gender trials, when the article was potentially informative, than on same-gender trials, when it was not, and this ability was correlated with productive measures of lexical and grammatical competence. Spanish-learning children who can speak only 500 words already use gender-marked articles in establishing reference, a processing advantage characteristic of native Spanish-speaking adults.},

This study oﬀers several options regarding New Orleans accents to actors, dialect teachers, directors, designers, and coaches for class, stage, or ﬁlm productions.

To examine diﬀerences among some New Orleans accents, the Yat and Uptown accents from Alvarez and Kolker’s 1985 ﬁlm Yeah You Rite! were compared with a Cajun French accent and portrayals of the Yat accent in New Orleans comics and newspapers. This study’s transcriptions of New Orleans speakers from diﬀerent neighborhoods document variation in the production of vowels, consonants, and rhoticity. Diﬀerences among the three studied accents were noted. However, inconsistences in vowels, consonants, and rhoticity within neighborhoods, and within the same individual’s speech, were observed more frequently than expected. Given that accents reﬂect character and culture, this examination of some characteristics of Yat, Uptown, and Cajun French accents presents options for increased nuance in the representation of New Orleans characters.},

	abstract = {We report two experiments that investigate the effects of sentence context on bilingual lexical access in Spanish and English. Highly proficient Spanish-English bilinguals read sentences in Spanish and English that included a marked word to be named. The word was either a cognate with similar orthography and/or phonology in the two languages, or a matched non-cognate control. Sentences appeared in one language alone (i.e., Spanish or English) and target words were not predictable on the basis of the preceding semantic context. In Experiment 1, we mixed the language of the sentence within a block such that sentences appeared in an alternating run in Spanish or in English. These conditions partly resemble normally occurring inter-sentential code-switching. In these mixed language sequences, cognates were named faster than non-cognates in both languages. There were no effects of switching the language of the sentence. In Experiment 2, with Spanish-English bilinguals matched closely to those who participated in the first experiment, we blocked the language of the sentences to encourage language-specific processes. The results were virtually identical to those of the mixed language experiment. In both cases, target cognates were named faster than non-cognates, and the magnitude of the effect did not change according to the broader context. Taken together, the results support the predictions of the Bilingual Interactive Activation + Model (Dijkstra \&amp; Van Heuven, 2002) in demonstrating that bilingual lexical access is language nonselective even under conditions in which language-specific cues should enable selective processing. They also demonstrate that, in contrast to lexical switching from one language to the other, inter-sentential code-switching of the sort in which bilinguals frequently engage, imposes no significant costs to lexical processing.},

Finalement, nous croyons que notre analyse joue bien le rôle d'une validation de principe pour ce qui est des outils actuels de l'analyse des réseaux sociaux et fait avancer du même coup l'étude du contact de langues.

Listeners’ sensitivity to the realization of (ING) words embedded in sentences was tested under various conditions. Comprehenders demonstrated expectations about the grammatical category constraints conditioning the realization of (ING) even though such knowledge may not be very informative about word recognition (Experiment 1). As more reliable phonetic information was available, listeners weighted grammatical expectations less, favoring other cues in the signal (Experiments 2 and 3). Bridging a gap between psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic accounts of probabilistic conditioning, these results suggest that factors beyond utility for word recognition may contribute to the probabilistic monitoring of a variable, and underscore the opportunistic nature of the speech comprehension system, where listeners make use of whatever information they have to process the signal.},

Further scrutiny of this result, however, illustrates that linguistic indexicality is not as straightforward as it originally appears. Subsequent analyses of the data highlight the ways in which the perceptual evaluation of sexuality is a highly contingent process, dependent upon a variety of sociolinguistic factors. An envelope of variation in listeners' affective judgments of a speaker is shown to exist, and it is argued that research on the perception of identity must go beyond identification of salient features, and also consider when and why these features are not salient.},

In particular, the research examines the potentially differing effects of white and African-American fieldworkers on interviews with African-American interviewees. Differing effects would be important for two reasons. First, much of the evidence on African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) comes from fieldwork done by whites. If black and white fieldworkers affect the data in significantly different ways, then much of the existing knowledge base on AAVE is open to question. Second, differing effects of fieldworkers would call into question a basic working assumption in sociolinguistics, that data collected in linguistic interviews reflect the typical linguistic behavior of informants. If the results of linguistic fieldwork are in part a function of different interviewers, then the data clearly do not represent typical linguistic behavior--that is, the kind of speech that informants use when they are not being observed by sociolinguists. In spite of the potential importance of interviewer effects on sociolinguistic data, few researchers have explored them in detail.},

This paper explores the synchrony and diachrony of differential object marking in Paraguayan Guaraní on the basis of a quantitative study of a corpus of naturally occurring data of the modern language and an investigation of object marking in a 17th-century catechism. We show that both animacy and topicality, but not definiteness, affect whether a direct object is marked in modern Guaraní, a finding that has implications for cross-linguistic theories of differential object marking, not all of which recognize topicality as a factor. We also find no categorical constraints on differential object marking in Guaraní, contrary to Bossong (1985b). Our study of the 17th-century catechism provides further support for Bossong's (1985b, 2009) claim that Guaraní did not have differential object marking when it came into contact with Spanish. The paper concludes with a discussion of the hypothesis that differential object marking in Guaraní resulted from contact with Spanish. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

The Linguistic Review 23: 351–379, 2006a). This article reports on an experiment designed to test to degree to which exposure to the concept of a region can also influence perception. In order to invoke the concept, we exposed participants, who were all speakers of New Zealand English, to either stuffed toy kangaroos and koalas (associated with Australia) or stuffed toy kiwis (associated with New Zealand). Participants then completed a perception task in which they matched natural vowels produced by a male New Zealander to vowels from a synthesized continuum which ranged from raised and fronted Australian-like tokens to lowered and centralized New Zealand-like tokens. Our results indicate that perception of the vowels shifted depending on which set of toys the participants had seen. This supports models of speech perception in which linguistic and nonlinguistic information are intricately entwined.},

	abstract = {Acoustic analysis of word-list and sentence data from a database of spoken New Zealand English is used to address the suggestion that a number of vowel contrasts in this variety are moving towards a quantity-based distinction. Data from 73 speakers across three age groups and two sexes are analysed, for a total of almost 6,000 vowel tokens. The move to a quantity distinction is confirmed for the strut‒start contrast. In the case of dress and fleece, younger and female speakers show greater overlap of the two vowels but also stronger diphthongisation of fleece. The data also confirm the fronting of foot away from thought and towards goose, but with no evident adjustment in durational contrasts or in the diphthongisation of either long vowel. Kit is becoming increasingly centralised, especially in the speech of young women, and is as a consequence becoming more distinct from nurse. The findings are discussed in the context of the system of vowel contrasts in this variety.},

However, such frequencies in isolation may sometimes be misleading since they do not take into consideration the degree of dispersion of the relevant linguistic variable. Many dispersion measures and adjusted frequency measures have been suggested but are neither widely known nor applied. Another unfortunate aspect of such measures is that many also come with a variety of problems. I pursue three objectives with this article. First, I want to raise awareness of this issue and make the available measures more widely known, so I present an overview of many measures of dispersion and adjusted frequencies. Second, I propose a conceptually simple alternative measure, DP, explain and exemplify it, and compare it to previously discussed measures. Third and most importantly, I urge corpus linguists to explore the notion of dispersion in more detail and outline a few proposals which steps to take next.},

	abstract = {This book is the revised and extended second edition of Statistics for Linguistics with R. The volume is an introduction to statistics for linguists using the open source software R. It is aimed at students and instructors/professors with little or no statistical background and is written in a non-technical and reader-friendly/accessible style. It first introduces in detail the overall logic underlying quantitative studies: exploration, hypothesis formulation and operationalization, and the notion and meaning of significance tests. It then introduces some basics of the software R relevant to statistical data analysis. A chapter on descriptive statistics explains how summary statistics for frequencies, averages, and correlations are generated with R and how they are graphically represented best. A chapter on analytical statistics explains how statistical tests are performed in R on the basis of many different linguistic case studies: For nearly every single example, it is explained what the structure of the test looks like, how hypotheses are formulated, explored, and tested for statistical significance, how the results are graphically represented, and how one would summarize them in a paper/article. A chapter on selected multifactorial methods introduces how more complex research designs can be studied: methods for the study of multifactorial frequency data, correlations, tests for means, and binary response data are discussed and exemplified step-by-step. Also, the exploratory approach of hierarchical cluster analysis is illustrated in detail. The book comes with many exercises, boxes with short think breaks and warnings, recommendations for further study, and answer keys as well as a statistics for linguists newsgroup on the companion website. Just like the first edition, it is aimed at students, faculty, and researchers with little or no statistical background in statistics or the open source programming language R. It avoids mathematical jargon and discusses the logic and structure of quantitative studies and introduces descriptive statistics as well as a range of monofactorial statistical tests for frequencies, distributions, means, dispersions, and correlations. The comprehensive revision includes new small sections on programming topics that facilitate statistical analysis, the addition of a variety of statistical functions readers can apply to their own data, a revision of overview sections on statistical tests and regression modeling, a complete rewrite of the chapter on multifactorial approaches, which now contains sections on linear regression, binary and ordinal logistic regression, multinomial and Poisson regression, and repeated-measures ANOVA, and a new visual tool to identify the right statistical test for a given problem and data set. The amount of code available from the companion website has doubled in size, providing much supplementary material on statistical tests and advanced plotting.},

This paper gives an evaluation of the basic assumptions underlying both the concept of the vowel space and the utility of the VSA in making cross-dialectal and sound change comparisons. Using cross-generational data from 135 female speakers representing three distinct dialects of American English, the first step was to establish that the vowel quadrilateral fails as a metric in the context of dialect variation. The next step was to examine the efficacy of more complete assessments of VSA represented by the convex hull and the concave hull. Despite the improvement over the quadrilateral, both metrics yielded inconsistent estimates of VSA. This paper then explores the possibility that regional variation can be characterized more effectively if formant dynamics and the resulting spectral overlap were also considered in defining the space. The proposed formant density approach showed that the working space may be common to all dialects but the differences are in the internal distribution of spectral density regions that define dialect-specific “usage” of the acoustic space. The dialect-inherent distribution of high and low density regions is largely shaped by sound change.},

This extension, however, has not been without controversy and continues to fuel heated debates in the field. This article addresses some of the contentious issues that quantitative research on (morpho-)syntactic variation has brought about. Can we operationalise variation in the field of morphosyntax as a sociolinguistic variable? If yes, how do we define such a variable? Is morphosyntax constrained in the same way as variation in the sound system? How do we quantify variability in the field of morphosyntax in an accountable manner? What do we quantify out of? I also introduce some of the methods used by researchers dealing with non-phonological variation, focusing especially on the quantification of morphosyntactic and discourse variables.},

	abstract = {This paper demonstrates the need for a uniform model of discourse variation analysis which is equipped to capture the complex nature of discourse variation and change whilst also ensuring generalizability. A review of the literature shows that the current heterogeneity in corpus construction, data quantification and theorizing of discourse variables impedes reliability and intersubjectivity. Suggestions are offered to achieve comparability, and a case is made for a consistent integration of pragmatic function as a factor group in the analysis. The extension of the variationist paradigm to the level of discourse is discussed, and the need for a definition of discourse variables which caters for their flexibility and multifunctionality is demonstrated. It is argued that some methodological consistency is required in variationist discourse analysis in order to advance towards a holistic description of patterns in language variation and change which spans all components of the grammar, and to systematically explore how discourse features are used and manipulated to create social identities. Dieser Beitrag plädiert für eine einheitliche Methode zur Diskursvariationsanalyse, welche der Komplexität von Dikursvariationen gerecht wird und Generalisierungen zulässt. Der Literaturüberblick ergibt, dass die gegenwärtige Heterogenität in der Zusammenstellung von Korpora, Datenquantifizierung und Konzeptualisierung von Diskursvariablen Zuverlässigkeit und Intersubjektivität beeinträchtigt. Es werden Vorschläge unterbreitet, wie man Vergleichbarkeit sicher stellen kann, und es wird für eine konsistente Integration von pragmatischen Funktionen als Faktorengruppe in der Analyse plädiert. Die Anwendung eines variationistischen Ansatzes auf die Analyse von Diskursmarkern wird erörtert. Des Weiteren wird die Notwendigkeit illustriert, Diskursmarker als Variable zu definieren, wobei ihre Flexibilität und Multifunktionalität berücksichtigt werden muss. Methodische Konsistenz ist erforderlich, um eine umfassende Theorie von Sprachvariation und -wandel zu formulieren und um systematisch zu analysieren, wie diese Variablen zur Konstruktion von sozialen Identitäten verwendet werden.},

Here we analyse vowel sounds from the annual Christmas messages broadcast by HRH Queen Elizabeth II during the period between the 1950s and 1980s. Our analysis reveals that the Queen's pronunciation of some vowels has been influenced by the standard southern-British accent of the 1980s which is more typically associated with speakers who are younger and lower in the social hierarchy.},

Although some near-native speakers retained ne more frequently than their interlocutors, others produced ne at rates indistinguishable from the NSs. A variationist analysis of 1,877 examples of negation revealed that the near-native speakers had largely acquired the relevant linguistic and sociostylistic factors that condition NS use, although an important subset of the near-native speakers did not vary their ne use according to whether the negation appears in a lexicalized or nonlexicalized phrase. The results contribute to understanding L2 near-nativeness, specifically with respect to sociolinguistic competence in adult learners.},

This monograph connects the jackknife, the bootstrap, and many other related ideas such as cross-validation, random subsampling, and balanced repeated replications into a unified exposition. The theoretical development is at an easy mathematical level and is supplemented by a large number of numerical examples. The methods described in this monograph form a useful set of tools for the applied statistician. They are particularly useful in problem areas where complicated data structures are common, for example, in censoring, missing data, and highly multivariate situations.},

In investigating such links between perceptual and conceptual representations, the use of modality-specific stimuli plays a central role. To aid researchers working in this area, we provide a set of norms for 423 adjectives, each describing an object property, with mean ratings of how strongly that property is experienced through each of five perceptual modalities (visual, haptic, auditory, olfactory, and gustatory). The data set also contains estimates of modality exclusivity-that is, a measure of the extent to which a particular property may be considered unimodal (i.e., perceived through one sense alone). Although there already exists a number of sets of word and object norms, we provide the first set to categorize words describing object properties along the dimensions of the five perceptual modalities. We hope that the norms will be of use to researchers working at the interface between linguistic, conceptual, and perceptual systems. The modality exclusivity norms may be downloaded as supplemental materials for this article from brm.psychonomic-journals.org/content/supplemental. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	abstract = {Louisiana French is undergoing gradual language death. In such situations, it is common to find increased variability and rapid change, as speakers use the language less often and in fewer domains (Wolfram 2004; Palosaari and Campbell 2011). These processes have been observed in the pronominal system of Louisiana French (Rottet 1996; Girard 2013), with both phonological and morphological sources of variation leading to an exceptionally large inventory of first-person-singular forms in the French of the Pointe-Au-Chien Indians of Pointe-Aux-Chênes, Louisiana. Using data from a translation task, we examine the range of forms used by French speakers from this community varying in age and fluency. We note a sharp distinction in forms used by fluent versus non-fluent speakers, with the latter making use of the non-clitic form mon. To answer the question of why mon is so common amongst non-fluent speakers in this task, we apply insights from the field of second language acquisition, considering the systems of these non-fluent speakers as autonomous and systematic. We ultimately propose a potential interaction between the previously documented phonological and morphological patterns observed in this community, influencing in the forms observed.},

In this chapter, I undertake to shed some light on this system as concerns, for instance, the use of a focus particle. I also show how interrogative data can be brought to bear on a recent scholarly debate concerning the number of geneses of Creole in Louisiana. In particular, I will provide evidence for the position taken by Klingler (2000), by giving further linguistic evidence that the Mississippi variety of LC has more in common with Haitian Creole than does the Bayou Teche variety.},

Method: A group comparison design was followed. The data were listener judgments, 1-min audiotaped excerpts of conversational speech, and transcribed language samples from 93 children (31 classified as specifically language impaired while the others were classified as either aged-matched or language-matched controls; 13 classified as SWE with CE, 40 classified as SWE only, 18 classified as SAAE with CE, and 22 classified as SAAE only). Results: Results indicated that children with a CE influence produced elevated rates of vernacular phonology relative to the others, with 2 patterns (nonaspirated stops and glide reduction) showing statistically significant group differences. In contrast, the children's use of vernacular morphology was unrelated to their CE status, but was instead related to their primary dialect (SWE vs. SAAE) and language ability classification (impaired vs. normal). Conclusions: The findings highlight the role of phonology in listeners' perceptions of dialect variation within 2 nonmainstream dialects (SWE and SAAE). The findings also demonstrate the ways phonological and morphological forms of vernacular can be independently influenced by different types of child variables.},

In this article I document these two interrogative patterns as to form and locales of attestation, and I explore the evidence for Byer's claim, showing that a strong case can be made by considering not only settlement history but also the interrogatives of Louisiana Creole, the origins of which arguably predate the arrival of the Acadians in Louisiana.},

question the generalizability of the principles to the

closed cultural enclave. The study of four sociolinguistic
variables and three generations of speakers reveals two
patterns of language change: a curvilinear or v-shaped
age pattern and a linear age pattern. These patterns relate
 in a complex way to changes from above and below the level
of consciousness. We support Eckert's call for a finer
specification of the social categories but suggest alternatives
to the ethnographic method. Using a variety of sources
of information on the social life and sociohistory of three
generations, we find an intimate association between the
sociohistory of this Cajun community and the linguistic
behavior of each generation.},

It constitutes the first monograph in the fields of Hebrew interactional linguistics and Hebrew discourse markers. The book first presents what is unique to the present approach to discourse markers and gives them an operational definition. Discourse markers are explored as a system, illuminating their patterning in terms of function, structure, and the moments in interaction at which they are employed. Next, detailed analysis of four Hebrew discourse markers illuminates not only the functions and grammaticization patterns of these markers, but also what they reveal about quintessential aspects of Israeli society, identity, and culture. The conclusion discusses commonalities and differences in the grammaticization patterns of the four markers, and relates the grammaticization of discourse markers from interaction to projectability in discourse.},

It is shown that from a structural point of view, the use of French markers presents no serious problems. Of course, the mere structural possibility of switching French markers cannot explain their near- categorical use. This phenomenon is best explained by taking into account the function of discourse markers as elements that create and strengthen discourse cohesion and coherence. In order to accomplish this task, discourse markers have to be as salient as possible. In bilingual discourse, this saliency may be maximized by using discourse markers from the language that is most salient. Since the language of morpho-syntax in Shaba Swahili/French discourse is Shaba Swahili, French markers stand out more clearly and have a higher contrastive value than their Shaba Swahili counterparts. Hence, French discourse markers are used instead of their Shaba Swahili equivalents. The importance of increasing contrastiveness as a way of maximizing saliency is evident from the fact that French markers are predominantly accompanied by pauses and/or prosodic cues, and from the fact that they predominantly occur in all-Shaba Swahili contexts, that is, they are followed and preceded by Shaba Swahili material in the majority of cases.},

We suggest interpretations of certain sociolinguistic findings, citing detailed evidence from research in Northern Ireland and Philadelphia, which emphasize the need for acknowledging the importance of looseknit network ties in facilitating linguistic innovations. We then propose that the link between network and class can be made via the notion of weak network ties using the process-based model of the macrolevel suggested by Thomas Højrup's theory of life-modes.]},

	abstract = {In recent years, the conceptualization of social support in the literature has become increasingly sophisticated, facilitating the consideration of more complex theories. Researchers no longer consider the mere availability of social ties, but look instead at the flow of specific resources through a social network. This article discusses how the social network has been defined in the context of social support. Research is reviewed, indicating how characteristics of individual tie (e.g., tie strength, proximity, frequency of contact, similarity) are related to the provision of support. Also examined are how characteristics of the personal network (e.g., size, density) relate to support and wellbeing. Statistical models for network analysis and how they should prove useful in studying social support are then discussed.},

	abstract = {We discuss some apparent limits on the acquisition of variation suggested by our recent work exploring how teenage migrants to the U.K. acquire local norms of variation. We focus on the constraints on the (ing) variable that emerged from a multivariate analysis. We find evidence for a systematisation of the variable among immigrants, involving some linguistically and cognitively predictable constraints, but also the emergence of social constraints not found in the teenage native speakers. We argue that transformation of variable constraints is a necessary artefact of the inherent complexity of sociolinguistic variables, particularly those with social indexicality. This research note: (1) delineates some theoretical and practical questions involved in incorporating social indexing in variationist studies, especially of non-native speakers; and (2) further explores reallocation (transformation) in the study of language contact. Wir behandeln mögliche Grenzen des Erwerbs soziolinguistischer Variation, die unsere jüngste Studie zum Erwerb lokaler Variationsnormen jugendlicher Immigranten in Großbritannien zu zeigen scheint. In unserer Ergebnisdarstellung konzentrieren wir uns auf die Faktoren, die die Verwendung der (ing) Variable beschränken. Die Ergebnisse gingen aus einer multivariaten Datenanalyse hervor. Wir zeigen, dass die Variable unter Immigranten systematisiert wird, was das Erscheinen einiger linguistischer und kognitiv voraussagbarer Faktoren aber auch einiger interessanter sozialer Faktoren einschließt, die nicht unter den jugendlichen Muttersprachlern gefunden werden konnten. Wir zeigen weiterhin, dass die Umwandlung variabler Faktoren ein notwendiges Artefakt der inhärenten Komplexität soziolinguistischer Variablen ist, insbesondere von Variablen mit sozialer Indexikalität. Diese Notiz umreißt einige praktische Fragen in Bezug auf (1) die Einfügung sozialer Indizes in variationslinguistische Studien, insbesondere solcher, die Nicht-Muttersprachler betreffen, und (2) die weitere Erforschung des Prozesses der Umverteilung in der Untersuchung von Sprachkontaktphänomenen.

Stable variables have been shown to exhibit a curvilinear pattern with age in which adolescents use nonstandard variants at a higher rate than adults do. An analysis of the morphophonological variable (ing) was carried out using recordings and ethnographic observations of 13 young American women during and after their final years of high school. Offering a detailed look at the late adolescent life stage, the study also explores speakers’ motivations for retaining or retreating from nonstandard variants as they prepare to enter adulthood. These are examined at both the group and the individual level. The results indicate that the degree of retreat from nonstandard variants is socially differentiated, in line with apparent time findings. Future enrollment in a locally oriented college, and alignment to a local ethnic network (Irish or Italian)—not social class—were the predictors of retention in high school.},

Building on the foundational work of Labov et al. (2006, 2011) on the “sociolinguistic monitor” (a proposed cognitive mechanism responsible for sociolinguistic perception), we examine whether listeners’ evaluative judgments of speech change as a function of the type of variable presented. We consider two variables in British English, ING and TH-fronting, which we argue differ in their relative social salience. Replicating the design of Labov et al.’s studies, we test 149 British listeners’ reactions to different quantitative distributions of these variables. Our experiments elicit a very different pattern of perceptual responses than those reported previously. In particular, our results suggest that a variable’s social salience determines both whether and how it is perceptually evaluated. We argue that this finding is crucial for understanding how sociolinguistic information is cognitively processed.},

This study used a matched guise experiment to examine the impact of the English variable (ING) on social perceptions of speakers presented as professors, political candidates, or experienced professionals. As predicted, profession shifted the impact of (ING) on perceived knowledgeability, such that professors were seen as more knowledgeable when using -ing, whereas experienced professionals were more knowledgeable in their -in guises. Use of -in also made all speakers sound less caring and created a positive relationship between political progressiveness and caring in perceptions of political candidates.},

The corpus contains a total of over 36 h of recordings of 46 French speakers engaged in conversations with friends. Casual speech was elicited during three diﬀerent parts, which together provided around 90 min of speech from every pair of speakers. While Parts 1 and 2 did not require participants to perform any speciﬁc task, in Part 3 participants negotiated a common answer to general questions about society. Comparisons with the ESTER corpus of journalistic speech show that the two corpora contain speech of considerably diﬀerent registers. A number of indicators of casualness, including swear words, casual words, verlan, disﬂuencies and word repetitions, are more frequent in the NCCFr than in the ESTER corpus, while the use of double negation, an indicator of formal speech, is less frequent. In general, these estimates of casualness are constant through the three parts of the recording sessions and across speakers. Based on these facts, we conclude that our corpus is a rich resource of highly casual speech, and that it can be eﬀectively exploited by researchers in language science and technology.},

	abstract = {Research on Montreal French (Laberge and Sankoff 1979; Thibault 1991) has shown a spectacular rise in the use of indefinite tu (or vous) in recent decades, at the expense of the standard form on. Although grammars of French have traditionally passed over indefinite tu/vous in silence, Ashby's study of Tours French (1992) confirmed that the phenomenon exists in metropolitan French also. The historical time-depth of indefinite tu/vous has apparently not been explored previously, though Posner (1997) has suggested that indefinite tu is a modern feature, found especially in Canada. A survey of indefinite tu/vous in earlier periods and in a range of varieties forms the first part of this paper. Secondly, drawing on a corpus of French spoken in Picardy, northern France, the paper investigates the extent to which this use of the 2nd person pronouns: (i) helps to avoid ambiguity; (ii) co-occurs with another grammatical variable. Unlike the surveys of Montreal and Tours, the Picardy corpus includes a large majority of informants who used tu to address the interviewer, and this too is explored as a potential influence on speakers’ use of 2nd person pronouns with indefinite reference.},

	abstract = {This investigation aims to uncover the variation of the Spanish second-person singular subject pronoun tú ‘you.sg’ when it displaces its content away from the particular circumstances of the speaker and changes its deictic meaning to a resource for the objectivization of the utterance. The multiple repercussions of the formal variation (expression and omission) of this subject on internal and external levels of meaning will be explored. Essential to understanding this case of variation is the consideration of prominent features of the communicative situation, as well as the social identities and roles assumed by the speakers within it (including professional affiliation, transactional vs. interpersonal communicative stance and gender). The results of the analysis allow us to sketch basic interactional and discursive tendencies governing objectivizing uses of the second-person singular tú along the oral-written continuum},

In concluding, the fate of nous is discussed and directions for future research on computer-mediated communication are advanced.},

	abstract = {Although stylistic variation within social networks has been described in adults, this topic remains under-researched in children. One question that remains unanswered is the extent to which stylistic variation is the result of automatic alignment or of intentional, pragmatically motivated adjustment. We present an in-depth sociolinguistic case study of a 10-year-old boy, his family and four friends selected according to their place of birth and the duration of their relationship with the boy. Statistical analyses of sociolinguistic variables of French suggest that the child's use of these variants is influenced by pragmatic motivations but not by automatic alignment. La variation stylistique est bien décrite chez l’adulte. Toutefois, sa forme, ses mécanismes et ses fonctions ontogénétiques doivent être davantage étudiés chez l’enfant. Une question concerne notamment le degré auquel cette variation résulte d’un alignement automatique sur les usages de l’interlocuteur ou d’un ajustement intentionnel, fondé sur des motivations pragmatiques. Nous présentons une étude de cas approfondie d’un garçon de dix ans enregistré avec sa famille et quatre amis sélectionnés selon leur lieu de naissance et la durée de la relation amicale qui les lie à l’enfant cible. L’analyse statistique de variables sociolinguistiques du français suggère que cet enfant est capable d’ajustements subtils en fonction de l’identité des interlocuteurs. Plutôt que d’être sous-tendus par un alignement mimétique sur les usages d’autrui, ces ajustements semblent fondés sur des motivations pragmatiques et identitaires.},

This is clearly not the case. We argue that conversation is easy because of an interactive processing mechanism that leads to the alignment of linguistic representations between partners. Interactive alignment occurs via automatic alignment channels that are functionally similar to the automatic links between perception and behaviour (the so-called perception–behaviour expressway) proposed in recent accounts of social interaction. We conclude that humans are ‘designed’ for dialogue rather than monologue.},

some aspects of the structured variation found in adult speech are evident
in children's speech from the very start of language acquisition, and
input from the primary caregiver is crucial in this process. In this
article we contribute to this research by conducting a cross-sectional
analysis of the acquisition of variable forms in a Scottish dialect. Two
linguistic variables are targeted in the speech of eleven children
(2;10–3;6) and their primary caregivers. Quantitative analysis of
over 5000 contexts of use demonstrates that one variable is conditioned by
social and linguistic constraints in the speech of the caregiver and these
constraints are matched by the children. In contrast, the other variable
is influenced by a complex array of linguistic constraints only. We
explore the ramifications of these findings for understanding the
mechanisms involved in acquisition of variation from the very earliest
stages.We gratefully acknowledge the

The writing was done in class without alteration by anyone other than the writer, and the subject matter was not controlled by the investigators. In addition to sentence length, clause length, subordination ratio, and the kinds  of clauses, the study analyzes structures within a clause: coordinated structures, nominals, the verb auxiliary, main verbs and complements, modifiers of verbs, and predicate adjectives. The results of this study are discussed at length, and tables provide additional information about the procedures used and data obtained.

	abstract = {This paper investigates the degree to which individual speakers follow the morphosyntactic hierarchy governing grammatical constraints on (ING) in the Southern U.S. city of Raleigh, North Carolina. (ING) was used as the variable of study for its well-studied internal constraints and comparability to previous studies on the internal constraints of t/d deletion. A lexical category constraint hierarchy for the community was determined via multivariate mixed-effects statistical models, and each speaker's (ING) pattern was compared to this hierarchy. Results show maintenance in grammatical constraints even when taking phonological factors into account, unlike some work on t/d deletion. Uniformity exists across speakers with respect to the ordering of internal constraints despite the overall decline in rates of –in over time, but constraint weights (expressed as log odds) vary significantly from speaker to speaker, with no correlates to social or internal factors. These results have consequences for representation of individuals in terms of an aggregate pattern, questioning the consistency of factor weight values at the speaker level despite consistent ordering of constraints.},

The data consist of 13,167 tokens of (ING) from interviews with 132 speakers conducted in Raleigh, North Carolina. Results from mixed-effect logistic regression show a strong effect of frequency on the realization of (ING), and this effect interacts with phonological context of occurrence. Frequent occurrence in environments that favor -in amplify the effect of lexical frequency; conversely, frequent occurrence in environments that favor –ing dampen the effect of overall frequency. Frequency also interacts with year of birth, showing an entrenchment of high-frequency words, lagging behind the community change toward the –ing variant in apparent time. Overall, these findings support the usage-based position of frequency effects as the result of a dynamic interplay between context of use and cognitive systems.},

Cet article se propose de chercher si le système des salutations dans la culture étudiée n'a pas, outre la valeur informative que nous venons de mentionner, une valeur hiérarchisante visant à maintenir l'autorité parentale. De l'analyse exhaustive du corpus se dégage un modèle d'adresse sous forme de syntagme ainsi qu'un modèle du fonctionnement de son échange. Mais on s'aperçoit que le rendement des informations diffusées par ces deux modèles est nul. On se demande alors si à la lumière de textes de sociologues, psychologues et philosophes contemporains le système d'adresse dans sa force apodictique ne peut être envisagé comme une sorte de rituel destiné à perpétuer la domination des parents. Systems of address are usually studied on the premisses that each time an individual wants to open or close a speech communication with another individual or a group, the linguistic pattern he uses reflects the social and affective quality of their relationship. A thorough analysis of the data leads to the generation of a model of address as well as that of a model of exchange. But one finds evidence that the output of informations released by this two models is close to nothing. Thus the question one may ask itself is : is there any occulted value underlying the all structure ? Recent research dealing with sociology, psychoanalysis and philosophy shows that the system of address could be seen as a kind of ritual which would assess the parental authority.]},

As for vowels, more cases of complete devoicing and greater degrees of partial devoicing were found in French than in Spanish. Moreover, all French vowel types exhibit significantly lower F1 values than their Spanish counterparts. These findings indicate that the extent of reduction that a segment type can undergo in conversational speech can vary significantly across languages.

This reduction phenomenon appeared to be highly frequent, as more than half of the occurrences of this word in a corpus of casual French contained few or no acoustic traces of a vowel between [s] and [t]. All our durational analyses clearly supported a categorical absence of vowel /e/ in a subset of c’était tokens. This interpretation was also supported by our finding that the occurrence of complete elision and [e] duration in non-elision tokens were conditioned by different factors. However, spectral measures were consistent with the possibility that a highly reduced /e/ vowel is still present in elision tokens in spite of the durational evidence for categorical elision.

	abstract = {[In this paper we answer the question: Do people select interaction partners to enhance their self-image, or do they strive to maintain a stable view of self? Affect control theory, a quantified version of symbolic interactionism, predicts that individuals adopt strategies which maintain their identities in order to secure a stable definition of the situation. When individuals have low self-esteem, they select interactions that maintain this low self-esteem, even when these interactions cause negative emotions. Two experiments examined the cognitive, affective, and behavioral effects of identity-confirming and -disconfirming information. Study 1, which assessed the cognitive and emotional outcomes of identity-relevant feedback, revealed that people with both high and low self-esteem feel good when praised and bad when they receive negative feedback on their performance. People with low self-esteem, however, think that the criticism is accurate, and like the critic more than do people with high self-esteem. Study 2 examined the implications of these responses for social interaction. Consistent with affect control predictions, subjects selected interaction partners who provided identity-consistent feedback. People with low self-esteem preferred to interact with a critic rather than with someone who said flattering things about their performance, even though the negative feedback made them feel bad. We discuss our results in terms of their implications for role stability and for the behavior of people with chronically negative self-identities.]},

However, automated analysis of this data has been made difficult by background noise in this legacy corpus, originally recorded on reel-to-reel tape and later digitized to .wav format. In this paper, we compare the effect of noise reduction techniques on the acoustic signal and evaluate their effect on acoustic speech data. We use Praat to detect the quietest silence (measured using root-mean-square amplitude) in each sound file. The audio data contain silences that lack background noise (e.g., due to anonymization procedures), but these are excluded from selection. Each quietest silence is used to create a “noise profile,” which is removed from the audio using a scripted noise removal procedure in both Audacity and SoX. The success of each procedure is assessed with three-way comparisons of the amplitude of silences in uncleaned and cleaned audio, and vowel plots made with formant values extracted from uncleaned and cleaned audio. It is predicted that successful noise reduction will reduce the number of outliers occurring in F1, F2 space.},

	abstract = {Understanding worldwide patterns of language diversity has long been a goal for evolutionary scientists, linguists and philosophers. Research over the past decade has suggested that linguistic diversity may result from differences in the social environments in which languages evolve. Specifically, recent work found that languages spoken in larger communities typically have more systematic grammatical structures. However, in the real world, community size is confounded with other social factors such as network structure and the number of second languages learners in the community, and it is often assumed that linguistic simplification is driven by these factors instead. Here, we show that in contrast to previous assumptions, community size has a unique and important influence on linguistic structure. We experimentally examine the live formation of new languages created in the laboratory by small and larger groups, and find that larger groups of interacting participants develop more systematic languages over time, and do so faster and more consistently than small groups. Small groups also vary more in their linguistic behaviours, suggesting that small communities are more vulnerable to drift. These results show that community size predicts patterns of language diversity, and suggest that an increase in community size might have contributed to language evolution.},

While a model of linguistic competence is independent of temporal constraints, a model of linguistic performance must provide information as to the sequencing of events in real time.

We describe an experiment designed to follow up on this result in a New Zealand context. Participants listened to a New Zealand English (NZE) speaker reading a list of sentences. Each sentence appeared on the answer-sheet, with a target word underlined. For each sentence, participants were asked to select from a synthesized vowel continuum the token that best matched the target vowel produced by the speaker. Half the participants had an answer-sheet with the word ‘Australian’ written on it, and half had an answer-sheet with ‘New Zealander’ written on it. Participants in the two conditions behaved significantly differently from one another. For example, they were more likely to hear a higher fronter /i/ vowel when ‘Australian’ appeared on the answer sheet, and more likely to hear a centralized version when ‘New Zealander’ appeared – a trend which reflects production differences between the two dialects. This is despite the fact that nearly all participants reported that they knew they were listening to a New Zealander.

However, whether word-length effects in single word production exist is at present controversial. A series of experiments did not find evidence for such an effect. First, an experimental manipulation of word length in picture naming showed no latency differences. Second, Dutch and English speakers named 2 sets of either objects or words (monosyllabic names in Dutch and disyllabic names in English or vice versa). A length effect, which should manifest itself as an interaction between object set and response language, emerged in word naming but not in picture naming. Third, distractors consisting of the final syllable of disyllabic object names speeded up responses, but at the same time, no word-length effect was found. These results suggest that before the response is initiated, an entire word has been phonologically encoded, but only its initial syllable is placed in an articulatory buffer.

The study reported here demonstrates a previously unrecognised influence of vision upon speech perception. It stems from an observation that, on being shown a film of a young woman's talking head, in which repeated utterances of the syllable [ba] had been dubbed on to lip movements for [ga], normal adults reported hearing [da]. With the reverse dubbing process, a majority reported hearing [bagba] or [gaba]. When these subjects listened to the soundtrack from the film, without visual input, or when they watched untreated film, they reported the syllables accurately as repetitions of [ba] or [ga]. Subsequent replications confirm the reliability of these findings; they have important implications for the understanding of speech perception.},

One cue, prosodic disjuncture, is detected by a decision tree-based ensemble classifier that uses acoustic cues to identify where normal prosody seems to be interrupted (Lickley, 1996). The other cue, syntactic parallelism, codifies the expectation that repairs continue a syntactic category that was left unfinished in the reparandum (Levelt, 1983). The two cues are combined in a Treebank PCFG whose states are split using a few simple tree transformations. Parsing performance on the Switchboard and Fisher corpora suggests that these two cues help to locate speech repairs in a synergistic way.},

DisMo is a hybrid system that uses a combination of lexical resources, rules, and statistical models based on Conditional Random Fields (CRF). In this paper, we present the first public version of DisMo for French. The system is trained and its performance evaluated on a 57k-token corpus, including different varieties of French spoken in three countries (Belgium, France and Switzerland). DisMo supports a multi-level annotation scheme, in which the tokenisation to minimal word units is complemented with multi-word unit groupings (each having associated POS tags), as well as separate levels for annotating disfluencies and discourse phenomena. We present the system's architecture, linguistic resources and its hierarchical tag-set. Results show that DisMo achieves a precision of 95\% (finest tag-set) to 96.8\% (coarse tag-set) in POS-tagging non-punctuated, sound-aligned transcriptions of spoken French, while also offering substantial possibilities for automated multi-level annotation.},

The study makes use of 10 hours of French radio interview archives, involving journalists and personalities from political or civil society. A first type of transcripts is press-oriented: most disfluencies are discarded. For 10\% of the corpus, we produced exact audio transcripts: all audible phenomena and overlapping speech segments are transcribed manually. In these transcripts, about 14\% of the words correspond to disfluencies and discourse markers. The audio corpus has then been transcribed using the LIMSI speech recogniser. With 8\% of the corpus, the disfluency words explain 12\% of the overall error rate. This shows that disfluencies have no major effect on neighbouring speech segments. Restarts are the most error prone, with a 36.9\% within class error rate.},

Since these disﬂuencies are relatively easy to detect, weakly supervised training is an effective way to minimize labeling costs. By explicitly modeling these, we improve general disﬂuency detection within and across domains, and we provide a richer transcript.},

	doi = {10.1016/0010-0277(83)90026-4},
	abstract = {Making a self-repair in speech typically proceeds in three phases. The first phase involves the monitoring of one's own speech and the interruption of the flow of speech when trouble is detected. From an analysis of 959 spontaneous self-repairs it appears that interrupting follows detection promptly, with the exception that correct words tend to be completed. Another finding is that detection of trouble improves towards the end of constituents. The second phase is characterized by hesitation, pausing, but especially the use of so-called editing terms. Which editing term is used depends on the nature of the speech trouble in a rather regular fashion: Speech errors induce other editing terms than words that are merely inappropriate, and trouble which is detected quickly by the speaker is preferably signalled by the use of ‘uh’. The third phase consists of making the repair proper. The linguistic well-formedness of a repair is not dependent on the speaker's respecting the integrity of constituents, but on the structural relation between original utterance and repair. A bi-conditional well-formedness rule links this relation to a corresponding relation between the conjuncts of a coordination. It is suggested that a similar relation holds also between question and answer. In all three cases the speaker respects certain structural commitments derived from an original utterance. It was finally shown that the editing term plus the first word of the repair proper almost always contain sufficient information for the listener to decide how the repair should be related to the original utterance. Speakers almost never produce misleading information in this respect. It is argued that speakers have little or no access to their speech production process; self-monitoring is probably based on parsing one's own inner or overt speech.
Résumé
L'auto-correction dans le discours se fait typiquement en trois temps. Dans un premier temps, le locuteur contrôle sa propre parole et l'interrompt lorsqu'il rencontre un problème. Une analyse de 959 corrections spontanées indique que l'interruption suit de très près la perception du problème, à l'exception près que le locuteur a tendance à finir les mots corrects. Les résultats de cette analyse indiquent d'autre part que la perception du problème s'améliore vers la fin des constituants. Le deuxième temps se caractérise par des hésitations, des pauses, mais surtout par l'utilisation de ce qu' on peut appeler les ‘commentaires rédactionnels’. Ceux-ci sont liés de façon suffisamment régulaire à la correction particulière qui est faite: ils sont différents lorsqu'il s'agit d'une véritable erreur et lorsqu'il s'agit simplement d'une mauvaise tournure de phrase. La présence immédiate du problème est signalée par l'utilisation de ‘uh’. Dans le troisième temps a lieu la correction elle-même. La bonne-formation des corrections ne dépend pas de ce que le locuteur respecte l'intégrité des constituants, mais plutôt de la relation structurelle qui existe entre le premier énoncé et la correction. Cette relation est liée à la relation correspondante entre les éléments conjoints d'une coordination par une règle de bonne formation bi-conditionnelle. On peut également suggérer qu'il existe une relation semblable entre questions et réponses. Dans ces trois cas, le locuteur respecte les contraintes structurelles de son premier énoncé. Enfin, l'analyse démontre que l'ensemble formé par le ‘commentaire rédactionnel’ et le premier mot de la correction elle-même contient presque toujours des éléments d'information permettant à l'interlocuteur de décider comment il faut relier la correction au premier énoncé. De ce point de vue, les locuteurs ne produisent presque jamais d'énoncés qui pourraient induire leur interlocuteur en erreur. Ces résultats indiquent que le locuteur a peu ou pas du tout d'accès au processus de production d'énoncés; l'auto-contrôle se fait plutôt à partir de la compréhension de sa propre parole intérieure ou extérieure.},

The volume recognizes the distinct merging of interests among dialectologists, sociolinguists, and students of language with theories of language generally. Essays address the areal distribution of sounds, words, and constructions and focus on social depth and discourse practices, perhaps the two most influential styles of contemporary research. The volume also includes extensive coverage of variation in languages other than English and clearly indicates research that remains to be done.},

	abstract = {Review: "Often considered merely a repository of archaic or even Elizabethan English, the language of southern Appalachia represents a distinctive American dialect that is both conservative and innovative. This dictionary marks the first comprehensive, historical record of the traditional speech of this region. Focusing on the Smoky Mountains of East Tennessee and Western North Carolina, it features more than six thousand names, usages, meanings, and folk expressions that are found in the region, exemplified by more than fifteen thousand documented quotations." "The Dictionary of Smoky Mountain English is the product of more than sixty years' work by the late Joseph S. Hall, a scholar who spent much of his life documenting Smoky Mountain speech and lore beginning in 1937, and Michael B. Montgomery, who assumed editorship of the dictionary in 1990. It is based on hundred of recordings and written sources that date as far back as the late eighteenth century and includes interviews with elderly residents in the 1930s, early church minutes, Civil War letters, local fiction, and written commentaries on mountain speech." "The dictionary is rich in the terminology of traditional mountain culture, illuminating regional practices connected with herbal medicine, moonshining, farming, cooking, music, religious customs, and many other areas. Popular nomenclature for flora and fauna forms a major component of the dictionary. Grammatical forms and patterns are covered in particular detail because they are often hallmarks of southern Appalachian English." "Each entry contains a headword or phrase with variant forms and spellings, one or more definitions, dated citations, and etymology. The volume includes a user's guide and an overview of the grammar, which covers points of usage regarding nouns, pronouns, verbs, adverbs, conjunctions, prefixes and suffixes, and other grammatical elements of Smoky Mountain speech."--BOOK JACKET.},

It represents a type of speech referred to by E. Haugen as a ‘bilingual’ dialect, having developed out of a stable Spanish-English setting. In their book, the authors provide a comprehensive examination of Chicano English, devoting particular emphasis to the social factors determining its characteristic features and uses. Special attention is given to the question of homogeneity as against ordered variation within Chicano English, to features of pronunciation and grammar, to its communicative functions, to the evaluative attitudes of its speakers and others and, finally, to its uses in literature and the media. In spite of its importance, Chicano English has been insufficiently documented; this monograph is intended to contribute towards redressing the balance.},

The Lumbee Native American Indians, the largest Native American group east of the Mississippi River and the largest group in the United States without reservation land, lost their ancestral language relatively early in their contact with outside groups, but they have carved out a unique English dialect niche which now distinguishes them from cohort European American and African American vernaculars. Processes of selective accommodation, differential language change and language innovation have operated to develop this distinct ethnic variety, while their cultural isolation and sense of "otherness" in a bi-polar racial setting have served to maintain its ethnic marking.},
